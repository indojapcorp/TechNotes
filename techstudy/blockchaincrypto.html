<h3>Bitcoin Improvement Proposal</h3>

<h3>A&nbsp;Bitcoin Improvement Proposal&nbsp;(BIP) is&nbsp;<strong>a formal proposal to change Bitcoin</strong>. The BIP process organizes the Bitcoin community in the absence of a centralized leader. BIPs can propose changes to Bitcoin&#39;s consensus layer, community standards, or the development process.</h3>

<h3>UTXO Model</h3>

<p>An unspent&nbsp;<em>transaction</em>&nbsp;output (<em>UTXO</em>) is the technical term for the amount of digital currency that remains after a&nbsp;<em>cryptocurrency transaction</em>.</p>

<h3>Decentralized Finance (DeFi)&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Decentralized finance (<em>DeFi</em>) is an emerging financial technology based on secure distributed ledgers similar to those used by cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Centralized Finance (CeFi)&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main idea behind a centralized exchange is that all the&nbsp;<em>crypto</em>&nbsp;trading orders are routed through a central exchange in centralized finance.Centralized finance is a financial activity in which individuals can earn interest and obtain loans on their cryptocurrency via centralized exchanges. Private keys to your crypto assets would be transferred to your preferred third-party company in order to conduct your preferred payments and coin orders. CeFi&rsquo;s goal is to optimize the performance and cost-efficiency of transactional services while ensuring fair exchanges.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consensus</p>

<p>A consensus mechanism is a fault-tolerant mechanism that is used in computer and blockchain systems to achieve the necessary agreement on a single data value or a single state of the network among distributed processes or multi-agent systems, such as with cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Nakamoto Consensus</p>

<p>Nakamoto Consensus places a large emphasis on the longest chain, arguing that the longest chain that is also valid according to timestamps (none of the blocks are invalid due to double-spent transactions, for example) is the most legitimate, as it had the largest amount of computational resources dedicated to it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What are the different types of blockchain consensus protocols?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Proof of Work (PoW)</li>
	<li>Proof of Stake (PoS)</li>
	<li>Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)</li>
	<li>Transaction as Proof of Stake (TaPoS)</li>
	<li>Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT)</li>
	<li>Casper.</li>

<p>Coins Vs Tokens</p>

<p>The crypto industry has said that the key distinction between coins and tokens is that&nbsp;<strong>crypto coins are the native asset of a Blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum, whereas crypto tokens are created by platforms and applications that are built on top of an existing Blockchain</strong>.Are Tokens the Same as Coins? Coins and tokens both represent a store of value, much like fiat currency, such as dollars, euros, yen, etc. But there&#39;s a crucial difference:&nbsp;<strong>digital coins are a form of money, while digital tokens represent something that can be assigned a price</strong>.</p>

<p>Can a token become a coin?</p>

<p><strong>Tokens can eventually become coins when the project develops its own blockchain and migrate their tokens to the new blockchain as a coin</strong>. Successful migration cases include Binance Coin (BNB), Tron (TRX), Zilliqa (ZIL) which previously existed as tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.coins have their own blockchain and tokens don&#39;t, is Ethereum a coin or token? Since Ethereum has its own blockchain,&nbsp;<strong>it&#39;s a coin</strong>. This also means that if you have a wallet that supports Ethereum, all assets that use the Ethereum blockchain, such as ERC20 tokens, are compatible with your wallet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Decentralized applications.</h2>

<p>Smart Contracts and decentralized applications are the future of more industries than banking. For now though, the greatest innovations are happening in finance, but they will grow to affect every aspect of our lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many new tokens and dApps are already being built upon the Ethereum blockchain. The best dApps aim to solve common problems in the cryptospace and the real world, leveraging the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>8 Essential Ethereum Blockchain Tokens</strong></p>

</ul>

<p>ERC&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ethereum request for comment)</p>

<p>ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, and ERC777, etc.An ERC20 token is&nbsp;<strong>a standard used for creating and issuing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain</strong>. Smart contracts can then be used to create smart property or tokenized assets that people can invest in.It provides the set of rules that all Ethereum tokens or ERC20 tokens must follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ether and ERC20 tokens have gained quite a popularity owing to their different use-cases and accessibility features. Most of the tokens minted on the ethereum blockchain have diverse utilities making them one of the most sought-after&nbsp;defi projects.</p>

<p>HOW TO CHOOSE THE BEST ERC20 WALLET</p>

<p>The factors to keep in mind while choosing the best ERC20 wallet are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Easy and user-friendly interface.</li>
	<li>The wallet must give you control over your private keys.</li>
	<li>The wallet must be compatible with your chosen device.</li>
	<li>Always choose wallets with backup options.</li>
	<li>Read and research about the team behind the ERC20 wallet.</li>

<p>1. IPO (INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING)</p>

<p>Initial public offering&nbsp;is the process by which a private company can go public by sale of its stocks to general public.</p>

<p>2. ICO (INITIAL COIN OFFERING)</p>

<p>ICO is usually used to launch a new service or product in the crypto market like a new cryptocurrency token or an app. It is in fact very similar to IPO (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="en.wikipedia.org">Initial Public Offering</a>) which is used by a new company to raise funds when it ventures into the stock market for the first time.</p>

<p>3. IEO (INITIAL EXCHANGE OFFERING)</p>

<p>In IEO companies directly sell their tokens in the exchange to individual participants without offering them in an ICO.</p>

<p>4. IDO (INITIAL DEX OFFERING)</p>

<p>IDO is a special case of IEO. The main difference between IEO and IDO is that IDO is executed on a decentralized exchange.</p>

<p>5. STO (SECURITY TOKEN OFFERING)</p>

<p>Security Token Offering is another fundraising tool but is more complex and difficult compared to an ICO.</p>

<p>What are automated market makers AMM in DeFi?</p>

<p>Instead of relying on the traditional buyers and sellers in a financial market, AMMs keep the DeFi ecosystem liquid 24/7 via liquidity pools.</p>

<p>Automated market makers (AMM) are&nbsp;<strong>decentralized exchanges that pool liquidity from users and price the assets within the pool using algorithms</strong>. The exact mechanics vary from exchange to exchange, but generally, AMMs offer deep liquidity, low transaction fees, and 100% uptime for as many users as possible.</p>

<p>Automated market makers (AMMs) are part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. They allow digital assets to be traded in a permissionless and automatic way by using liquidity pools rather than a traditional market of buyers and sellers. AMM users supply liquidity pools with crypto tokens, whose prices are determined by a constant mathematical formula. Liquidity pools can be optimized for different purposes, and are proving to be an important instrument in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>

</ul>

<p>Automated market makers&nbsp;(AMMs) allow digital assets to be traded without permission and automatically by using&nbsp;liquidity pools&nbsp;instead of a traditional market of buyers and sellers. On a&nbsp;traditional exchange platform, buyers and sellers offer up different prices for an asset. When other users find a listed price to be acceptable, they execute a trade and that price becomes the asset&rsquo;s market price. Stocks, gold, real estate, and most other assets rely on this traditional market structure for trading. However, AMMs have a different approach to trading assets.</p>

<p>AMMs are a financial tool unique to&nbsp;Ethereum&nbsp;and decentralized finance (DeFi). This new technology is decentralized, always available for trading, and does not rely on the traditional interaction between buyers and sellers. This new method of exchanging assets embodies the ideals of Ethereum, crypto, and blockchain technology in general: no one entity controls the system, and anyone can build new solutions and participate.</p>

<h2>Liquidity Pools and Liquidity Providers</h2>

<p>Liquidity&nbsp;refers to how easily one asset can be converted into another asset, often a fiat currency, without affecting its market price. Before AMMs came into play, liquidity was a challenge for&nbsp;decentralized exchanges&nbsp;(DEXs) on Ethereum. As a new technology with a complicated interface, the number of buyers and sellers was small, which meant it was difficult to find enough people willing to trade on a regular basis. AMMs fix this problem of limited liquidity by creating liquidity pools and offering&nbsp;liquidity providers&nbsp;the incentive to supply these pools with assets. The more assets in a pool and the more liquidity the pool has, the easier trading becomes on decentralized exchanges.</p>

<p>On AMM platforms, instead of trading between buyers and sellers, users trade against a pool of tokens &mdash; a liquidity pool. At its core, a liquidity pool is a shared pot of tokens. Users supply liquidity pools with tokens and the price of the tokens in the pool is determined by a mathematical formula. By tweaking the formula, liquidity pools can be optimized for different purposes.</p>

<p>Anyone with an internet connection and in possession of any type of&nbsp;ERC-20 tokens&nbsp;can become a liquidity provider by supplying tokens to an AMM&rsquo;s liquidity pool. Liquidity providers normally earn a fee for providing tokens to the pool. This fee is paid by traders who interact with the liquidity pool. Recently, liquidity providers have also been able to earn yield in the form of project tokens through what is known as &ldquo;yield farming.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Constant Product Formula</h2>

<p>AMMs have become a primary way to trade assets in the DeFi ecosystem, and it all began with a blog post about &ldquo;on-chain market makers&rdquo; by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. The secret ingredient of AMMs is a simple mathematical formula that can take many forms. The most common one was proposed by Vitalik as:</p>

<p>tokenA_balance(p) * tokenB_balance(p) = k</p>

<p>and popularized by Uniswap as:</p>

<p>x * y = k</p>

<p>The constant, represented by&nbsp;&ldquo;k&rdquo;&nbsp;means there is a constant balance of assets that determines the price of tokens in a liquidity pool. For example, if an AMM has ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC), two volatile assets, every time ETH is bought, the price of ETH goes up as there is less ETH in the pool than before the purchase. Conversely, the price of BTC goes down as there is more BTC in the pool. The pool stays in constant balance, where the total value of ETH in the pool will always equal the total value of BTC in the pool. Only when new liquidity providers join in will the pool expand in size. Visually, the prices of tokens in an AMM pool follow a curve determined by the formula.</p>

<p>In this constant state of balance, buying one ETH brings the price of ETH up slightly along the curve, and selling one ETH brings the price of ETH down slightly along the curve. The opposite happens to the price of BTC in an ETH-BTC pool. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how volatile the price gets, there will eventually be a return to a state of balance that reflects a relatively accurate market price. If the AMM price ventures too far from market prices on other exchanges, the model incentivizes traders to take advantage of the price differences between the AMM and outside crypto exchanges until it is balanced once again.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;constant formula&nbsp;is a unique component of AMMs &mdash; it determines how the different AMMs function.</p>

<h2>Automated Market Maker Variations</h2>

<p>In Vitalik Buterin&rsquo;s original post calling for automated or&nbsp;on-chain&nbsp;money markets, he emphasized that AMMs should not be the only available option for decentralized trading. Instead, there needed to be many ways to trade tokens, since non-AMM exchanges were vital to keeping AMM prices accurate. What he didn&rsquo;t foresee, however, was the development of various approaches to AMMs.</p>

<p>The DeFi ecosystem evolves quickly, but three dominant AMM models have emerged:&nbsp;Uniswap,&nbsp;Curve, and&nbsp;Balancer.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Uniswap&rsquo;s pioneering technology allows users to create a liquidity pool with any pair of ERC-20 tokens with a 50/50 ratio, and has become the most enduring AMM model on Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Curve specializes in creating liquidity pools of similar assets such as stablecoins, and as a result, offers some of the lowest rates and most efficient trades in the industry while solving the problem of limited liquidity.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Balancer stretches the limits of Uniswap by allowing users to create dynamic liquidity pools of up to eight different assets in any ratio, thus expanding AMMs&rsquo; flexibility.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Although Automated Market Makers harness a new technology, iterations of it have already proven an essential financial instrument in the fast-evolving DeFi ecosystem and a sign of a maturing industry.</p>

<p>Yield Farming vs Staking - The Best Way to Invest in Cryptocurrencies</p>

<p><strong>Yield farming is risky but provides short term returns.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Staking, on the other hand, is much more suited for beginners</strong>. It&#39;s easy to understand and doesn&#39;t require a large initial investment. In addition, there will always be a need for coin staking to create new nodes on the blockchain.<strong>Yield farming cryptos lets users grow their investment while also having positive effects on the overall state of a coin</strong>. Once money gets added to the liquidity pool, interest rates can even rise if the demand is high. That&#39;s why yield farming DAI or ETH can be a good move since both coins are popular at the moment.Yield farming is&nbsp;<strong>the process of token holders maximizing rewards across various DeFi platforms</strong>. Yield farmers provide liquidity to various token pairs and earn rewards in cryptocurrencies. Top yield farming protocols include Aave, Curve Finance, Uniswap and many others.</p>

<p><strong>5 Best Yield Farming Crypto Platforms 2022</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>DeFi Swap - Highest APY Yield Farming Platform.</li>
	<li>AQRU - Simple Daily Yield Payments.</li>
	<li>eToro - Most Regulated Crypto Platform open to the United States.</li>
	<li>Crypto.com - Up to 14.5% Annual Yield as Crypto Interest.</li>
	<li>Coinbase - Yield Farming in the US.</li>
</ul>

<p>How much can you earn with yield farming?</p>

<p>In terms of earning interest, the platform offers reasonable APYs on both stablecoins and traditional digital assets. Regarding the former, you can earn an APY of&nbsp;<strong>up to 9.25% when you deposit Tether into your BlockFi account</strong>. And, this rate is paid up to the first 20,000 USDT deposited and without a lock-up period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What is APY in staking?</p>

<p>Annual Percentage Yield (APY) refers to a percentage rate reflecting the total amount of staking rewards projected to be earned over an annual period based on the then-current Rewards Rate compounding at set intervals for a 365-day period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is staking crypto safe?</p>

<p><strong>Whether or not staking crypto is worth it will depend on an individual&#39;s risk tolerance</strong>. Risk-averse crypto earners may prefer to maintain ownership of their assets without putting them at risk. On the other hand, risk-takers would likely be more than happy to stake their crypto for higher potential returns.</p>

<p>advantage of PoS over mining is that&nbsp;<strong>the energy consumption in staking is drastically lower</strong>. That&#39;s why many blockchains are moving towards a PoS/staking model to reduce the negative environmental impact of cryptocurrency trading.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What are the sidechains?</p>

<p>What is a sidechain? A sidechain is&nbsp;<strong>a separate blockchain network that connects to another blockchain &ndash; called a parent blockchain or mainnet &ndash; via a two-way peg</strong>.</p>

<p>The two-way peg enables interchangeability of assets at a predetermined rate between the parent blockchain and the sidechain.</p>

<p><strong>Sidechains are responsible for their own security</strong>. If there isn&#39;t enough mining power to secure a sidechain, it could be hacked. Since each sidechain is independent, if it is hacked or compromised, the damage will be contained within that chain and won&#39;t affect the main chain.</p>

<p>The main difference between sidechains and Ethereum layer 2 solutions is that&nbsp;<strong>while layer 2 inherits the security of the main Ethereum network, sidechains rely on their own security</strong>. An Ethereum sidechain is a separate blockchain network that runs in parallel to the Ethereum main chain.In the most general sense, a&nbsp;<em>sidechain</em>&nbsp;can be described as a blockchain that can interact with another blockchain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sidechains allow cryptocurrencies to interact with one another. They add flexibility and allow developers to experiment with Beta releases of Altcoins or software updates before pushing them on to the main chain. Traditional banking functions like issuing and tracking ownership of shares can be tested on sidechains before moving them onto main chains. If the security mechanisms for sidechains can be bolstered, sidechain technology holds promise for massive blockchain scalability.</p>

<p>Sidechain Advantages:</p>

<p>Sidechains bring three main benefits: scalability, experimentation/upgradeability, and diversification.</p>

<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: A sidechain can offer faster and cheaper transactions through many optimizations, for example, by moving a certain type of transaction to another chain whose protocol is purpose built for that type of transaction. This should decongest the first chain, making the first chain faster and cheaper too. Sidechains can also use much faster, newer techniques that are more efficient.</p>

<p><strong>Experimentation/upgradeability</strong>: Upgrading an entrenched blockchain with diverse stakeholders can be difficult. Reaching consensus can be slow, if not impossible. Sidechains allow new ideas to be tested and deployed without broad consensus. This experimentation and upgradeability enables many of the efficiencies that contribute to scalability.</p>

<p><strong>Diversification</strong>: Assets from other blockchains can be made accessible to more people. Applications such as lending and borrowing in DeFi can gain access to assets from other chains.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Drawbacks of sidechains</h3>

<p>Sidechains are responsible for their own security; a sidechain&rsquo;s security is not derived from the blockchain it is bridged with. This is both a positive and a negative. It means poor security in one blockchain does not affect the security of the connected blockchain. However, this means popular blockchains like Bitcoin cannot lend any security strength to smaller, less popular blockchains.</p>

<p>On a related note, sidechains require their own miners. A large pool of diverse miners is an important way most blockchains secure their network. Newer chains must do their best to grow their mining ecosystem, but this can be difficult because newer chains are often less lucrative for miners. Sidechains can make this even worse, because in parent-child sidechains, the child chain typically does not have its own native coin. This acts as a disincentive for miners because their chief source of income is from the issuance of native coins.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>sidechain examples</h3>

<p>Drivechain</p>

<p>Drivechain is an example of the second type of sidechain mentioned above -- &lsquo;parent-child.&rsquo; Bitcoin is the parent and Drivechain is the child, thus Drivechain does not issue a native token. Instead, it relies solely on BTC transferred from the Bitcoin network. Drivechain uses SPV to implement its 2-way peg, which relies on miners to validate transfers. 51% attacks by a coalition of miners are possible. A unique feature of Drivechain is the creation of&nbsp;blind merged mining&nbsp;(BMM), which addresses the drawback of sidechains requiring their own miners. BMM allows a miner on the Bitcoin blockchain (parent) to mine on Drivechain (child) without running a Drivechain full node, and the miner is paid in BTC.</p>

<p>Drivechain hopes to give people the ability to transfer bitcoins from the Bitcoin network to sidechains and back. This will hopefully give bitcoin holders access to a diverse range of blockchains.</p>

<p>SmartBCH</p>

<p>SmartBCH&nbsp;is an example of the first type of sidechain -- two independent blockchains. SmartBCH is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and&nbsp;Web3-compatible sidechain for&nbsp;Bitcoin Cash, but does not have its own native token. SmartBCH uses a unique bridge called SHA-Gate. Transferring from BCH to SmartBCH is handled by BCH full-node clients. Transferring from SmartBCH to BCH uses a federation for operation, and miners for supervision.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is Binance a sidechain?</p>

<p><strong>BNB Chain, a Layer 1 blockchain founded by crypto exchange Binance</strong>, plans to introduce sidechains to cut the cost and increase the speed of transactions for resource intense applications such as gaming</p>

<p><strong>Binance Smart Chain &mdash;BSC&mdash; is a blockchain system from the crypto-trading platform Binance</strong>. BSC is designed to provide a high-performance infrastructure for decentralised trading, building dApps, interoperability between other blockchains, and support of smart contracts and other DeFi products.</p>

<p>What runs on Binance smart chain?</p>

<p>What is the Binance smart chain network? BSC is a new smart contract platform launched by Binance based on the Go Ethereum (Geth) client, making it compatible with&nbsp;<strong>blockchain apps developed for the Ethereum network</strong>. It is, however, much cheaper and faster to run the same apps on BSC than on Ethereum.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In April 2020, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was introduced by the crypto exchange Binance to enable DApp development with&nbsp;<strong>larger capacity, faster speeds, and lower latency compared to Ethereum</strong>.</p>

<p>Is Polkadot better than Ethereum?</p>

<p>Scalability.&nbsp;<strong>Polkadot is a high-performance blockchain that can handle over 1000 transactions per second</strong>. In comparison, Ethereum supports 13-30 transactions per second in its current state. It&#39;s also far cheaper to send DOT compared to ETH at the moment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, after all of that, the questions present itself: with all of these responsibilities, how does one train someone with the necessary skills to let them rise to the challenge of Blockchain development? There are two different situations at work here. There are the Blockchain hopefuls who are starting completely from scratch, having no background in programming whatsoever, and those who have experience in careers that share similarities with Blockchain.</p>

<h2>What Kind of Mindset Do You Need to Become a Blockchain Developer?</h2>

<p>Before we dive into those two different types of people aspiring to become Blockchain developers, it may help to familiarize ourselves with the kind of mindsets that are best suited for Blockchain developers. After all, the unique challenges of Blockchain development require a certain unique way of thinking.</p>

<p>Whenever you hear the word &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; spoken aloud, it&rsquo;s not usually in a positive light; no self-respecting business wants anything to do with hackers (well, except for ethical hackers, but that&rsquo;s a different story for a different time). However, it&rsquo;s precisely the hacker mentality that helps make good Blockchain developers. That&rsquo;s because hackers tend to think outside the box when faced with problems and obstacles, rather than engage in conventional thinking.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a good Blockchain developer works well with a team and can collaborate. On a related point, the ideal Blockchain developer knows when to ask for help with a problem and when to keep plugging away by themselves until they arrive at the answer.</p>

	<h3>Learn Why Blockchain Was Needed in the First Place</h3>
	The story of Blockchain is the story of Bitcoin, as the latter is the reason that the former exists. Blockchain was designed as a platform for Bitcoin, allowing it to become a reality. To this end, an aspiring Blockchain developer should become familiar with Bitcoin, including actually&nbsp;<a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/blockchain-tutorial/what-is-cryptocurrency" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="purchasing some cryptocurrency">purchasing some cryptocurrency</a>&nbsp;to get one&rsquo;s feet wet. Additionally, check out Bitcoin forums featured on Reddit, stay current on Blockchain news on Coindesk, and take a glance at some cryptocurrency vlogs on YouTube. Any research you can do, any immersion in the world of cryptocurrency you can manage will be to your advantage.</li>

<h1>What is Public Key Cryptography?</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Public key&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/cryptography" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cryptography</a>&nbsp;(PKC), also known as asymmetric cryptography, is a framework that uses both a private and a public key, as opposed to the single key used in symmetric cryptography. The use of key pairs gives PKC a unique set of characteristics and capabilities that can be utilized to solve challenges inherent in other cryptographic techniques. This form of cryptography has become an important element of modern computer security, as well as a critical component of the growing&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/cryptocurrency" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cryptocurrency</a>&nbsp;ecosystem.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h2>How does public key cryptography work?</h2>

<p>In a PKC scheme, the public key is used by a sender to&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/encryption" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">encrypt</a>&nbsp;information, while the private key is used by a recipient to decrypt it. Because the two keys are different from one another, the public key can be safely shared without compromising the security of the private one. Each asymmetric key pair is unique, ensuring that a message encrypted using a public key can only be read by the person who possesses the corresponding private key.</p>

<p>Because asymmetric encryption algorithms generate key pairs that are mathematically linked, their key lengths are much longer than those used in symmetric cryptography. This longer length - typically between 1,024 and 2,048 bits - makes it extremely difficult to compute a private key from its public counterpart. One of the most commons&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/algorithm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">algorithm</a>&nbsp;for asymmetric encryption in use today is known as RSA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the RSA scheme, keys are generated using a modulus that is arrived at by multiplying two numbers (often two large prime numbers). In basic terms, the modulus generates two keys (one public that can be shared, and one private that should be kept in secret). The RSA algorithm was first described in 1977 by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (hence, RSA) and remains a major component of public key cryptography systems.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h2>PKC as an encryption tool</h2>

<p>Public key cryptography solves one of the long-standing problems of symmetric algorithms, which is the communication of the key that is used for both encryption and decryption. Sending this key over an insecure connection risks exposing it to third parties, who can then read any messages encrypted with the shared key. Although cryptographic techniques (such as the Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange protocol) exist to solve this problem, they are still vulnerable to attacks. In public key cryptography, by contrast, the key used for encryption can be shared securely over any connection. As a result, asymmetric algorithms offer a higher level of protection when compared to the symmetric ones.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h2>Generating digital signatures</h2>

<p>Another application of asymmetric cryptography algorithms is that of authenticating data through the use of digital signatures. Basically speaking, a digital signature is a hash created using the data in a message. When that message is sent, the signature can be checked by the recipient using the sender&#39;s public key. This way, they can authenticate the source of the message and ensure that it has not been tampered with. In some cases, digital signatures and encryption are applied together, meaning the hash itself may be encrypted as part of the message. It should be noted, however, that not all digital signature schemes use encryption techniques.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>Although it can be used to enhance computer security and provide verification of message integrity, PKC does have some limitations. Owing to the complex mathematical operations involved in encryption and decryption, asymmetric algorithms can be quite slow when forced to deal with large amounts of data. This type of cryptography also depends heavily on the assumption that the private key will remain secret. If a private key is accidentally shared or exposed, the security of all messages that have been encrypted with its corresponding public key will be compromised. It is also possible for users to accidentally lose their private keys, in which case it becomes impossible for them to access the encrypted data.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h2>Applications of public key cryptography</h2>

<p>This type of cryptography is used by many modern computer systems to provide security for sensitive information. Emails, for example, can be encrypted using public key cryptography techniques to keep their contents confidential.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The secure sockets layer (SSL) protocol that makes secure connections to websites possible also employs asymmetric cryptography. PKC systems have even been explored as a means of providing a secure electronic voting environment that would potentially allow voters to participate in elections from their home computers.</p>

<p>PKC also features prominently in&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/how-does-blockchain-work" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blockchain</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-cryptocurrency" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cryptocurrency</a>&nbsp;technology. When a new cryptocurrency wallet is set up, a pair of keys is generated (public and private keys). The wallet address is generated using the public key and can be securely shared with others. The private key, on the other hand, is used for creating digital signatures and verifying transactions, and therefore, must be kept in secret.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once a transaction has been verified by confirming the hash contained in the digital signature, that transaction can be added to the blockchain ledger. This system of digital signature verification ensures that only the person who has the private key associated with the corresponding cryptocurrency wallet can move the funds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It should be noted that the asymmetric cryptography used in cryptocurrency applications are different from those used for computer security purposes.&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-bitcoin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-ethereum" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>, for instance, use a specific algorithm to verify transactions, known as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Also, the ECDSA creates digital signatures without the use of encryption. This means that blockchain doesn&#39;t need encryption, unlike many tend to believe.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>

<p>From computer security to verifying cryptocurrency transactions, public key cryptography plays an important role in securing modern digital systems. By using paired public and private keys, asymmetric cryptography algorithms resolve fundamental security concerns presented by symmetric ciphers. Although PKC has been in use for many years, new uses and applications are regularly being developed for it, particularly in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>-------------</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption</h3>

<p>Encryption algorithms are often divided into two categories, known as symmetric and asymmetric encryption. The fundamental difference between these two methods of encryption relies on the fact that symmetric encryption algorithms make use of a single key, while asymmetric encryption makes use of two different but related keys. Such a distinction, though apparently simple, accounts for the functional differences between the two forms of encryption techniques and the ways they are used.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Understanding encryption keys</h3>

<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/cryptography" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cryptography</a>, encryption algorithms generate keys as a series of bits that are used for encrypting and decrypting a piece of information. The way in which those keys are employed accounts for the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-symmetric-key-cryptography" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">symmetric encryption</a>&nbsp;algorithms use the same key to perform both the encryption and decryption functions, an asymmetric encryption algorithm, by contrast, uses one key to encrypt the data and another key to decrypt it. In&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-public-key-cryptography" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asymmetric systems</a>, the key used for encryption is known as the public key and can be freely shared with others. On the other hand, the key used for decryption is the private key and should be kept in secret.</p>

<p>For example, if Alice sends Bob a message that is protected by symmetric encryption, she needs to share the same key she used for encryption with Bob so that he can decrypt the message. This means that if a malicious actor intercepts the key, they are able to access the encrypted information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, if Alice uses an asymmetric scheme instead, she encrypts the message with Bob&rsquo;s public key, so Bob will be able to decrypt it with his private key. Thus, asymmetric encryption offers a higher level of security because even if someone intercepts their messages and finds Bob&rsquo;s public key, they are not able to decrypt the message.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Key lengths</h3>

<p>Another functional difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption is related to the length of the keys, which are measured in bits and are directly related to the level of security provided by each cryptographic algorithm.</p>

<p>In symmetric schemes, the keys are randomly selected, and their lengths are usually set at 128 or 256 bits, depending on the required level of security. In asymmetric encryption, however, there must be a mathematical relationship between the public and private keys, meaning that there is a mathematical pattern between the two. Due to the fact that this pattern can potentially be exploited by attackers to crack the encryption, asymmetric keys need to be much longer to present an equivalent level of security. The difference in key length is so pronounced that a 128-bit symmetric key and a 2,048-bit asymmetric key offer roughly similar levels of security.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Advantages and disadvantages</h3>

<p>Both types of&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/encryption" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">encryption</a>&nbsp;have advantages and disadvantages relative to one another. Symmetric encryption algorithms are much faster and require less computational power, but their main weakness is key distribution. Because the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt information, that key must be distributed to anyone who would need to access the data, which naturally opens up security risks (as previously illustrated).</p>

<p>Conversely, asymmetric encryption solves the problem of key distribution by using public keys for encryption and private keys for decryption. The tradeoff, however, is that asymmetric encryption systems are very slow by comparison to symmetric systems and require much more computing power as a result of their vastly longer key lengths.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Use cases</h3>

<h4>Symmetric encryption</h4>

<p>Because of its greater speed, symmetric encryption is widely used to protect data in many modern computer systems. For example, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), is used by the United States government to encrypt classified and sensitive information. The AES replaced the previously Data Encryption Standard (DES), which was developed in the 1970s as a standard for symmetric encryption.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Asymmetric encryption</h4>

<p>Asymmetric encryption can be applied to systems in which many users may need to encrypt and decrypt a message or set of data, especially when speed and computing power are not primary concerns. One example of such a system is encrypted email, in which a public key can be used to encrypt a message, and a private key can be used to decrypt it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Hybrid systems</h4>

<p>In many applications, symmetric and asymmetric encryption are used together. Typical examples of such hybrid systems are the Security Sockets Layer (SSL) and the Transport Layer Security (TLS) cryptographic protocols, which were designed to provide secure communication within the Internet. The SSL protocols are now considered insecure and its use should be discontinued. In contrast, the TLS protocols are deemed safe and have been extensively used by all major web browsers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Do cryptocurrencies use encryption?</h3>

<p>Encryption techniques are used in many cryptocurrencies wallets as a way to provide increased levels of security to the end-users. Encryption algorithms are applied, for example, when users set up a password for their&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/crypto-wallet-types-explained" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crypto wallets</a>, which means the file used to access the software was encrypted.</p>

<p>However, due to the fact that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies make use of public-private key pairs, there is a common misconception that blockchain systems make use of asymmetric encryption algorithms. As previously noted, though, asymmetric encryption and digital signatures are two major use cases of asymmetric cryptography (<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-public-key-cryptography" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public-key cryptography</a>).</p>

<p>Therefore, not all digital signature systems make use of encryption techniques, even if they present a public and a private key. In fact, a message can be digitally signed without being encrypted. The RSA is one example of an algorithm that can be used for signing encrypted messages, but the digital signature algorithm used by Bitcoin (named ECDSA) does not use encryption at all.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Closing thoughts</h3>

<p>Both symmetric and asymmetric encryption play important roles in keeping sensitive information and communications secure in today&#39;s digitally dependent world. Though both can be useful, they each have their own advantages and disadvantages and so are put to different applications. As the science of cryptography continues to evolve to defend against newer and more sophisticated threats, both symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic systems will likely remain relevant to computer security.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>What Is Proof of Work (PoW)?</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Proof of Work (commonly abbreviated to PoW) is a mechanism for preventing double-spends. Most major cryptocurrencies use this as their&nbsp;<em>consensus algorithm</em>. That&rsquo;s just what we call a method for securing the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s ledger.</p>

<p>Proof of Work was the first consensus algorithm to surface, and, to date, remains the dominant one. It was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in the 2008 Bitcoin white paper, but the technology itself was conceived long before then.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adam Back&rsquo;s&nbsp;HashCash&nbsp;is an early example of a Proof of Work algorithm in the pre-cryptocurrency days. By requiring senders to perform a small amount of computing before sending an email, receivers could mitigate spam. This computation would cost virtually nothing to a legitimate sender, but quickly add up for someone sending emails en masse.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is a double-spend?</h2>

<p>A double-spend occurs when the same funds are spent more than once. The term is used almost exclusively in the context of digital money &ndash; after all, you&rsquo;d have a hard time spending the same physical cash twice. When you pay for a coffee today, you hand cash over to a cashier who probably locks it in a register. You can&rsquo;t go to the coffee shop across the road and pay for another coffee with the same bill.</p>

<p>In digital cash schemes, there&rsquo;s the possibility that you could. You&rsquo;ve surely duplicated a computer file before &ndash; you just copy and paste it. You can email the same file to ten, twenty, fifty people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since digital money is just data, you need to prevent people from copying and spending the same units in different places. Otherwise, your currency will collapse in no time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a more in-depth look at double-spending, check out&nbsp;<em>Double Spending Explained</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why is Proof of Work necessary?</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve read our&nbsp;guide to blockchain technology, you&rsquo;ll know that users broadcast transactions to the network. Those transactions aren&rsquo;t immediately considered valid, though. That only happens when they get added to the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The blockchain is a big database that every user can see, so they can check if funds have been spent before. Picture it like this: you and three friends have a notepad. Anytime one of you wants to make a transfer of whatever units you&rsquo;re using, you write it down &ndash;&nbsp;<em>Alice pays Bob five units, Bob pays Carol two units</em>, etc.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another intricacy here &ndash; each time you make a transaction, you refer to the transaction where the funds came from. So, if Bob was paying Carol with two units, the entry would actually look like the following:&nbsp;<em>Bob pays Carol two units from this earlier transaction with Alice</em>.</p>

<p>Now, we have a way to track the units. If Bob tries to make another transaction using the same units he just sent to Carol, everyone will know immediately. The group won&rsquo;t allow the transaction to be added to the notepad.</p>

<p>Now, this might work well in a small group. Everyone knows each other, so they&rsquo;ll probably agree on which of the friends should add transactions to the notepad. What if we want a group of 10,000 participants? The notepad idea doesn&rsquo;t scale well, because nobody wants to trust a stranger to manage it.</p>

<p>This is where Proof of Work comes in. It ensures that users aren&rsquo;t spending money that they don&rsquo;t have the right to spend. By using a combination of game theory and cryptography, a PoW algorithm enables anyone to update the blockchain according to the rules of the system.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How does PoW work?</h2>

<p>Our notepad above is the blockchain. But we don&rsquo;t add transactions one by one &ndash; instead, we lump them into blocks. We announce the transactions to the network, then users creating a block will include them in a candidate block. The transactions will only be considered valid once their candidate block becomes a confirmed block, meaning that it has been added to the blockchain.</p>

<p>Appending a block isn&rsquo;t cheap, however. Proof of Work requires that a&nbsp;<em>miner</em>&nbsp;(the user creating the block) uses up some of their own resources for the privilege. That resource is computing power, which is used to&nbsp;<em>hash</em>&nbsp;the block&rsquo;s data until a solution to a puzzle is found.</p>

<p>Hashing the block&rsquo;s data means that you pass it through a&nbsp;hashing function&nbsp;to generate a block hash. The block hash works like a &ldquo;fingerprint&rdquo; &ndash; it&rsquo;s an identity for your input data and is unique to each block.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s virtually impossible to reverse a block hash to get the input data. Knowing an input, however, it&rsquo;s trivial for you to confirm that the hash is correct. You&nbsp;just have to submit the input through the function and check if the output is the same.</p>

<p>In Proof of Work, you must provide data whose hash matches certain conditions. But you don&rsquo;t know how to get there. Your only option is to pass your data through a hash function and to check if it matches the conditions. If it doesn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll have to change your data slightly to get a different hash. Changing even one character in your data will result in a totally different result, so there&rsquo;s no way of predicting what an output might be.</p>

<p>As a result, if you want to create a block, you&rsquo;re playing a guessing game. You typically take information on all of the transactions that you want to add and some other important data, then hash it all together. But since your dataset won&rsquo;t change, you need to add a piece of information that is variable. Otherwise, you would always get the same hash as output. This variable data is what we call a&nbsp;<em>nonce</em>. It&rsquo;s a number that you&rsquo;ll change with every attempt, so you&rsquo;re getting a different hash every time. And this is what we call&nbsp;<em>mining</em>.</p>

<p>Summing up, mining is the process of gathering blockchain data and hashing it along with a nonce until you find a particular hash. If you find a hash that satisfies the conditions set out by the protocol, you get the right to broadcast the new block to the network. At this point, the other participants of the network update their blockchains to include the new block.</p>

<p>For major cryptocurrencies today, the conditions are incredibly challenging to satisfy. The higher the hash rate on the network, the more difficult it is to find a valid hash. This is done to ensure that blocks aren&rsquo;t found too quickly.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, trying to guess massive amounts of hashes can be costly on your computer. You&rsquo;re wasting computational cycles and electricity. But the protocol will reward you with cryptocurrency if you find a valid hash.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s recap what we know so far:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It&rsquo;s expensive for you to mine.</li>
	<li>You&rsquo;re rewarded if you produce a valid block.</li>
	<li>Knowing an input, a user can easily check its hash &ndash; non-mining users can verify that a block is valid without expending much computational power.</li>
</ul>

<p>So far, so good. But what if you try to cheat? What&rsquo;s to stop you from putting a bunch of fraudulent transactions into the block and producing a valid hash?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where public-key cryptography comes in. We won&rsquo;t go into depth in this article, but check out&nbsp;<em>What is Public-Key Cryptography?</em>&nbsp;for a comprehensive look at it. In short, we use some neat cryptographic tricks that allow any user to verify whether someone has a right to move the funds they&rsquo;re attempting to spend.</p>

<p>When you create a transaction, you sign it. Anyone on the network can compare your signature with your&nbsp;<em>public key</em>, and check whether they match. They&rsquo;ll also check if you can actually spend your funds and that the sum of your inputs is higher than the sum of your outputs (i.e., that you&rsquo;re not spending more than you have).</p>

<p>Any block that includes an invalid transaction will be automatically rejected by the network. It&rsquo;s expensive for you to even attempt to cheat. You&rsquo;ll waste your own resources without any reward.</p>

<p>Therein lies the beauty of Proof of Work:&nbsp;<strong>it makes it expensive to cheat, but profitable to act honestly</strong>. Any rational miner will be seeking ROI, so they can be expected to behave in a way that guarantees revenue.</p>

<p>-----------------</p>

<h2>Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake</h2>

<p>There are many consensus algorithms, but one of the most highly-anticipated ones is&nbsp;Proof of Stake&nbsp;(PoS). The concept dates back to 2011, and has been implemented in some smaller protocols. But it has yet to see adoption in any of the big blockchains.</p>

<p>In Proof of Stake systems, miners are replaced with&nbsp;<em>validators</em>. There&rsquo;s no mining involved and no race to guess hashes. Instead, users are randomly selected &ndash; if they&rsquo;re picked, they must propose (or &ldquo;forge&rdquo;) a block. If the block is valid, they&rsquo;ll receive a reward made up of the fees from the block&rsquo;s transactions.</p>

<p>Not just any user can be selected, though &ndash; the protocol chooses them based on a number of factors. To be eligible, participants must lock up a&nbsp;<em>stake</em>, which is a predetermined amount of the blockchain&rsquo;s native currency. The stake works like bail: just as defendants put up a large sum of money to disincentivize them from skipping trial, validators lock up a stake to disincentivize cheating. If they act dishonestly, their stake (or a portion of it) will be taken.</p>

<p>Proof of Stake does have some benefits over Proof of Work. The most notable one is the smaller carbon footprint &ndash; since there&rsquo;s no need for high-powered&nbsp;mining farms&nbsp;in PoS, the electricity consumed is only a fraction of that consumed in PoW.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That said, it has nowhere near the track record of PoW. Although it could be perceived as wasteful, mining is the only consensus algorithm that&rsquo;s proven itself at scale. In just over a decade, it has secured trillions of dollars worth of transactions. To say with certainty whether PoS can rival its security, staking needs to be properly tested in the wild.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>What Is Hashing?</h1>

<p>Hashing refers to the process of generating a fixed-size output from an input of variable size. This is done through the use of mathematical formulas known as hash functions (implemented as hashing&nbsp;algorithms).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although not all hash functions involve the use of&nbsp;cryptography, the so-called cryptographic hash functions are at the core of cryptocurrencies. Thanks to them, blockchains and other distributed systems are able to achieve significant levels of&nbsp;data integrity and security.</p>

<p>Both conventional and cryptographic hash functions are deterministic. Being deterministic means that as long as the input doesn&rsquo;t change, the hashing algorithm will always produce the same output (also known as digest or hash).</p>

<p>Typically, the hashing algorithms of cryptocurrencies are designed as one-way functions, meaning they cannot be easily reverted without large amounts of computing time and resources. In other words, it is quite easy to create the output from the input, but relatively difficult to go in the opposite direction (to generate the input from the output alone). Generally speaking, the more difficult it is to find the input, the more secure the hashing algorithm is considered to be.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How does a hash function work?</h2>

<p>Different hash functions will produce outputs of differing sizes, but the possible output sizes for each hashing algorithm is always constant. For instance, the SHA-256 algorithm can only produce outputs of 256 bits, while the SHA-1 will always generate a 160-bits digest.</p>

<p>To illustrate, let&rsquo;s run the words &ldquo;Binance&rdquo; and &ldquo;binance&rdquo; through the SHA-256 hashing algorithm (the one used in Bitcoin).</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="2">
			<p>SHA-256</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Input</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Output (256 bits)</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Binance</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>f1624fcc63b615ac0e95daf9ab78434ec2e8ffe402144dc631b055f711225191</p>

			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note that a minor change (the casing of the first letter) resulted in a totally different hash value. But since we are using SHA-256, the outputs will always have a fixed size of 256-bits (or 64 characters) - regardless of the input size. Also, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many times we run the two words through the algorithm, the two outputs will remain constant.</p>

<p>Conversely, if we run the same inputs through the SHA-1 hashing algorithm, we would have the following results:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="2">
			<p>SHA-1</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Input</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Output (160 bits)</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Binance</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>7f0dc9146570c608ac9d6e0d11f8d409a1ee6ed1</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>binance</p>
			</td>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, the acronym SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithms. It refers to a set of cryptographic hash functions that include the SHA-0 and SHA-1 algorithms along with the SHA-2 and SHA-3 groups. The SHA-256 is part of the SHA-2 group, along with SHA-512 and other variants. Currently, only the SHA-2 and SHA-3 groups are considered secure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why do they matter?</h2>

<p>Conventional hash functions have a wide range of use cases, including database lookups, large files analyses, and data management. On the other hand, cryptographic hash functions are extensively used in information-security applications, such as message authentication and digital fingerprinting. When it comes to Bitcoin, cryptographic hash functions are an essential part of the&nbsp;mining&nbsp;process and also play a role in the generation of new addresses and keys.</p>

<p>The real power of hashing comes when dealing with enormous amounts of information. For instance, one can run a big file or dataset through a hash function and then use its output to quickly verify the accuracy and integrity of the data. This is possible because of the deterministic nature of hash functions: the input will always result in a simplified, condensed output (hash). Such a technique removes the need to store and &ldquo;remember&rdquo; large amounts of data.</p>

<p>Hashing is particularly useful within the context of blockchain technology. The Bitcoin blockchain has several operations that involve hashing, most of them within the process of mining. In fact, nearly all cryptocurrency protocols rely on hashing to link and condense groups of transactions into blocks, and also to produce cryptographic links between each block, effectively creating a blockchain.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Cryptographic hash functions</h2>

<p>Again, a hash function that deploys cryptographic techniques may be defined as a cryptographic hash function. In general, breaking a cryptographic hash function requires a myriad of brute-force attempts. For a person to &ldquo;revert&rdquo; a cryptographic hash function, they would need to guess what the input was by trial and error until the corresponding output is produced. However, there is also the possibility of different inputs producing the exact same output, in which case a &ldquo;collision&rdquo; occurs.</p>

<p>Technically, a cryptographic hash function needs to follow three properties to be considered effectively secure. We may describe those as collision resistance, preimage resistance, and second preimage resistance.</p>

<p>Before discussing each property, let&rsquo;s summarize their logic in three short sentences.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Collision resistance:&nbsp;infeasible to find any two distinct inputs that produce the same hash as output.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Preimage resistance:&nbsp;infeasible to &ldquo;revert&rdquo; the hash function (find the input from a given output).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Second-preimage resistance:&nbsp;infeasible to find any second input that collides with a specified input.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Collision resistance</h3>

<p>As mentioned, a collision happens when different inputs produce the exact same hash. Thus, a hash function is considered collision-resistant until the moment someone finds a collision. Note that collisions will always exist for any hash function because the possible inputs are infinite, while the possible outputs are finite.</p>

<p>Put in another way, a hash function is collision-resistant when the possibility of finding a collision is so low that it would require millions of years of computations. So despite the fact that there are no collision-free hash functions, some of them are strong enough to be considered resistant (e.g., SHA-256).</p>

<p>Among the various SHA algorithms, the SHA-0 and SHA-1 groups are no longer secure because collisions have been found. Currently, the SHA-2 and&nbsp;SHA-3&nbsp;groups are considered resistant to collisions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Preimage resistance</h3>

<p>The property of preimage resistance is related to the concept of one-way functions. A hash function is considered preimage-resistant when there is a very low probability of someone finding the input that generated a particular output.</p>

<p>Note that this property is different from the previous one because an attacker would be trying to guess what was the input by looking at a given output. A collision, on the other hand, occurs when someone finds two different inputs that generate the same output, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter which inputs were used.</p>

<p>The property of preimage resistance is valuable for protecting data because a simple hash of a message can prove its authenticity, without the need to disclose the information. In practice, many service providers and web applications store and use hashes generated from passwords rather than the passwords in plaintext.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Second-preimage resistance</h3>

<p>To simplify, we may say that the second-preimage resistance is somewhere in between the other two properties. A second-preimage attack occurs when someone is able to find a specific input that generates the same output of another input that they already know.</p>

<p>In other words, a second-preimage attack involves finding a collision, but instead of searching for two random inputs that generate the same hash, they search for an input that generates the same hash that was generated by another specific input.</p>

<p>Therefore, any hash function that is resistant to collisions is also resistant to second-preimage attacks, as the latter will always imply a collision. However, one can still perform a preimage attack on a collision-resistant function as it implies finding a single input from a single output.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Mining</h2>

<p>There are many steps in Bitcoin&nbsp;mining&nbsp;that involves hash functions, such as checking balances, linking transactions inputs and outputs, and hashing transactions within a block to form a&nbsp;Merkle Tree. But one of the main reasons Bitcoin&nbsp;blockchain is secure&nbsp;is the fact that miners need to perform a myriad of hashing operations in order to eventually find a valid solution for the next block.</p>

<p>Specifically, a miner has to try several different inputs when creating a hash value for their&nbsp;candidate block. In essence, they will only be able to validate their block if they generate an output hash that starts with a certain number of zeros. The number of zeros is what determines the mining difficulty, and it varies according to the hash rate devoted to the network.</p>

<p>In this case, the hash rate represents how much computer power is being invested in Bitcoin mining. If the network&#39;s hash rate increases, the Bitcoin protocol will automatically adjust the mining difficulty so that the average time needed to mine a block remains close to 10 minutes. In contrast, if several miners decide to stop mining, causing the hash rate to drop significantly, the mining difficulty will be adjusted, making it easier to mine (until the average block time comes back to 10 minutes).</p>

<p>Note that miners don&#39;t have to find collisions because there are multiple hashes they can generate as a valid output (starting of a certain number of zeros). So there are several possible solutions for a certain block, and miners only have to find one of them - according to the threshold determined by the mining difficulty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because Bitcoin mining is a cost-intensive task, miners have no reason to cheat the system as it would lead to significant financial losses. The more miners join a blockchain, the bigger and stronger it gets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>

<p>There is no doubt that hash functions are essential tools in computer science, especially when dealing with huge amounts of data. When combined with cryptography, hashing algorithms can be quite versatile, offering security and authentication in many different ways. As such, cryptographic hash functions are vital to nearly all cryptocurrencies networks, so understanding their properties and working mechanisms is certainly helpful for anyone interested in blockchain technology.</p>
