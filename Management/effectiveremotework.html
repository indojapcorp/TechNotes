<h1>Effective Remote Work</h1>

<h2>For Yourself, Your Team, and Your Company</h2>

<p>The office isn&rsquo;t as essential as it used to be. Flexible working hours and distributed teams are replacing decades of on-site, open-plan office culture. Wherever you work from nowadays, your colleagues are likely to be somewhere else. No more whiteboards. No more water coolers. And certainly no Ping-Pong. So how can you organize yourself, ship software, communicate, and be impactful as part of a globally distributed workforce? We&rsquo;ll show you how. It&rsquo;s time to adopt a brand new mindset. Remote working is here to stay. Come and join us.</p>

<hr />
<p>Remote working is on the rise. Whether or not we are remote workers, it is likely we are all part of a global workforce. We need to learn to interact remotely, because we are all remote from someone in some way. Rather than simply simulating the way we&rsquo;d usually work together via digital means, we have to learn new communication skills and adopt a different mindset in order to work remotely effectively, efficiently, and, most importantly, healthily.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start by getting you set up with the right equipment and habits. Then, we&rsquo;ll learn the mindset of treating everyone as remote, and conquer both synchronous and asynchronous communication. You&rsquo;ll learn how to produce amazing artifacts, how to communicate clearly, and how to manage yourself and your teams. Then we&rsquo;ll look at the bigger picture: from measuring the remote readiness of your workplace, to creating a handbook for your team, to exploring remote-first culture and tackling burnout and mental well-being.</p>

<p>Fundamentally we&rsquo;ll see that adopting a remote-working mindset can do wonders for our organization, our effectiveness, and our impact in our careers. It can even create a more diverse and inclusive industry for us all to work in.</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? The remote future is now. Be a part of it.</p>
