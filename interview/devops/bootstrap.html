<p>45.&nbsp;<strong>How would you implement a carousel in bootstrap?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here is an example with a detailed explanation:</strong></p>

<pre>
<code>&lt;div id="myCarousel" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel"&gt;
 &lt;!-- Indicators --&gt;
 &lt;ul class="carousel-indicators"&gt;
   &lt;li data-target="#myCarousel" data-slide-to="0" class="active"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li data-target="#myCarousel" data-slide-to="1"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li data-target="#myCarousel" data-slide-to="2"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;!-- Wrapper --&gt;
 &lt;div class="carousel-inner"&gt;
   &lt;div class="carousel-item active"&gt;
     &lt;img src="ap.jpg" alt="Apple"&gt;
     &lt;div class="carousel-caption"&gt;
       &lt;h3&gt;APPLE&lt;/h3&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  
       &lt;div class="carousel-item"&gt;
     &lt;img src="or.jpg" alt="Orange"&gt;
     &lt;div class="carousel-caption"&gt;
       &lt;h3&gt;ORANGE&lt;/h3&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   
   &lt;div class="carousel-item"&gt;
      &lt;img src="kw.jpg" alt="Kiwi"&gt;
      &lt;div class="carousel-caption"&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;KIWI&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;!-- Left and Right Controls --&gt;
 &lt;a class="carousel-control-prev" href="#myCarousel" data-slide="prev"&gt;
   &lt;span class="carousel-control-prev-icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;a class="carousel-control-next" href="#myCarousel" data-slide="next"&gt;
   &lt;span class="carousel-control-next-icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The outermost &lt;div&gt; is as follows:</strong></p>

<p>For carousel controls to work properly, they must have an id (in this case, id=&rdquo;myCarousel&rdquo;).</p>

<p>This &lt;div&gt; has the class=&rdquo;carousel&rdquo; to indicate that it contains a carousel.</p>

<p>When a new item is displayed, the .slide class adds a CSS transition and animation effect that causes the objects to slide. If you don&rsquo;t want this effect, leave this class out.</p>

<p>When the page loads, the data-ride= &ldquo;carousel&rdquo; attribute tells Bootstrap to start animating the carousel right away.</p>

<p><strong>The section on &ldquo;Indicators&rdquo; is as follows:</strong></p>

<p>Each slide&rsquo;s indicators are the small dots at the bottom (which indicates how many slides there are in the carousel, and which slide the user is currently viewing).</p>

<p>With the class .carousel-indications, the indicators are supplied in an ordered list.</p>

<p>The data-target attribute refers to the carousel&rsquo;s id.</p>

<p>When a user clicks on a given dot, the data-slide-to attribute defines the slide they should go to.</p>

<p><strong>The &ldquo;Wrapper&rdquo; section is as follows:</strong></p>

<p>A div with the class .carousel-inner specifies the slides.</p>

<p>Each slide&rsquo;s content is defined by a div with the class .item. This can be in the form of text or visuals.</p>

<p>One of the slides must have the .active class applied to it. The carousel will not be viewable otherwise.</p>

<p>To generate a caption for each slide, a &lt;div class=&rdquo;carousel-caption&rdquo;&gt; is added within each &lt;div class=&rdquo;item&rdquo;&gt;.</p>

<p><strong>The section on &ldquo;Left and Right Controls&rdquo; is as follows:</strong></p>

<p>This code adds &ldquo;left&rdquo; and &ldquo;right&rdquo; buttons, allowing the user to manually navigate between slides.</p>

<p>The data-slide attribute takes the keywords &ldquo;prev&rdquo; or &ldquo;next,&rdquo; which change the position of the slide in relation to its current location.</p>

<p>46.&nbsp;<strong>What are glyphicons?</strong></p>

<p>Glyphicons are icon fonts that you can use on your website. Their developer has made them freely available for Bootstrap projects.</p>

<p>To utilize the icons, simply copy and paste the following code anywhere in your code. To ensure adequate padding, leave a space between the icon and the text.</p>

<pre>
<code>&lt;span class = "glyphicon glyphicon-search" &gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Note: Bootstrap 4 lacks an icon library of its own (Glyphicons from Bootstrap 3 are not supported in BS4).</p>

<p>47.&nbsp;<strong>What is bootstrap pagination and how are they classified?</strong></p>

<p>If your website has lots of pages, you might require adding some sort of pagination to each page.</p>

<pre>
<code>&lt;ul class="pagination"&gt;
   &lt;li class="page-item"&gt;&lt;a class="page-link" href="#"&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li class="page-item"&gt;&lt;a class="page-link" href="#"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li class="page-item"&gt;&lt;a class="page-link" href="#"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li class="page-item"&gt;&lt;a class="page-link" href="#"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li class="page-item"&gt;&lt;a class="page-link" href="#"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li class="page-item"&gt;&lt;a class="page-link" href="#"&gt;Next&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>48.&nbsp;<strong>In Bootstrap, what is a scrollspy?</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an auto-updating nav component that allows you to grab sections of the page based on where you&rsquo;re scrolling. Based on the scroll position, the .active class will update from one nav item to the next.</p>

<p>49.&nbsp;<strong>Why is Jumbotron used in Bootstrap?</strong></p>

<p>In Bootstrap, Jumbotron is used to highlight contents. It enlarges the headline and provides a margin for the landing page&rsquo;s content. In order to implement Jumbotron in Bootstrap, create a container div with the .jumbotron class.</p>

<p>50.&nbsp;<strong>What is a bootstrap card and how would you create one?</strong></p>

<p>In Bootstrap 4, a card is a bordered box with padding surrounding its content. It has options for headers, footers, content, and colors, among other things.</p>

<pre>
<code>&lt;div class="card"&gt;
 &lt;div class="card-header"&gt;Header&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="card-body"&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="card-footer"&gt;Footer&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Another example:</strong></p>

<p>&lt;div class=&rdquo;card&rdquo; style=&rdquo;width:400px&rdquo;&gt;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&lt;img class=&rdquo;card-img-top&rdquo; src=&rdquo;img_avatar.png&rdquo; alt=&rdquo;Card image&rdquo;&gt;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&lt;div class=&rdquo;card-body&rdquo;&gt;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;h4 class=&rdquo;card-title&rdquo;&gt;Richard Taylor&lt;/h4&gt;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;p class=&rdquo;card-text&rdquo;&gt;Some example text.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;a href=&rdquo;#&rdquo; class=&rdquo;btn btn-primary&rdquo;&gt;See Profile&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;/div&gt;</p>
