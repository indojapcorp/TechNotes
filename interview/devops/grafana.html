<p><strong>5. How do we edit the link in a slack notification from Grafana?</strong></p>

<p>We can edit notification by adding it to our ini File and use Grafana in building self referential:</p>

<p>_____________________________________-</p>

<pre>
<code>[server]
# Protocol (http or https)
protocol = http

# The http port  to use
https_port = 3000

# Domain is used in accessing grafana from a browser
domain = localhost

# The full public facing url
root_url = %(protocol)s://%(domain)s:%(http_port)s/
_____________________________</code></pre>

<p><strong>6. What are Grafana Alerts?</strong></p>

<p>Grafana Alerts helps in allows in attching rules in our dashboard panels, we can save the dashboard as it extracts the alert rules in a separate alert rule storage and schedules it for the evaluation.</p>

<p>Dashboard Alerts consists of 4 components as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Alerting Rule used in creating an alert.</li>
	<li>Contact Point used in sending notification when conditions of alerts rule are met.</li>

<p><strong>8. What is Grafana Dashboard Templates?</strong><br />
Grafana Dashboard Templates are used in making our dashboards interactive, we can create dashboard template variables which can be used anywhere in the Grafana Dashboard.These variables helps in allowing us in making dynamic changes to the dashboard.</p>

<p><strong>9. What are Cloud Metrics?</strong></p>

<p>Cloud Metrics helps in providing insights in our Cloud Computing and also predictive analysis of our system, and in determining when our servers are under load and requires provisioning.Cloud Metrics are also used in setting up thresholds through policies which will react in conditions during the cloud operations.It also allows the cloud in self healing with auto fixing in the event of any operational failures.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>14. What Is Graphite Grafana?</strong></p>

<p>Graphite is a monitoring tool yet again. It makes time series data storage and viewing easier. In a data monitoring setup, Graphite is best used as a data source for Grafana dashboard.<br />
Grafana provides an advanced Graphite query editor that allows us to interact with data using expressions and functions.</p>

<p><strong>15. How do I add alerts to Grafana?</strong></p>

<p>Create an alert rule by following below steps.</p>

<ul>

	<li>Select Edit rules from the drop-down menu.</li>
	<li>Select Add rule from the drop-down menu.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>16. What is Loki Grafana?</strong></p>

<p><strong>18. What is difference between Grafana and Kibana?</strong></p>

<p><img alt="Evaluate Grafana vs. Kibana for IT data visualization" src="https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/itops-kibana_vs_grafana-f_mobile.png" /></p>

<p>Difference between Grafana and Kibana</p>

<ul>
	<li>Kibana&rsquo;s main purpose was to analyze and monitor logs. In the ELK stack, K stands for Kibana. The ElasticSearch team developed Kibana with the goal of having a useful tool for monitoring logs. Instead of running Linux commands on the console to identify exceptions in production, simply navigate around and track the context from the Kibana.</li>
	<li>Grafana, on the other hand, is developed as a generic monitoring solution that can be used to monitor and analyze pretty much anything. This is a very high-level overview of the differences between the two tools.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>19. How do I create a drop down menu in Grafana dashboard based on a Sysdig metrics label?</strong></p>

<p>To do that you need to go in your dashboard, then :</p>

<p>Settings &gt; Variables &gt; New<br />
In the General block, you have to select Query as the variable type.<br />
In the Query Options block, you can select your datasource in the dropdown<br />
Then, in the same block, you&rsquo;ll have a Query textfield. Here you have to use the grafana function called label_values You can refer the documentation for this function.<br />
So basically, for our case, to retrieve the label value for the region label, will have to do something like this :</p>

<hr />
<pre>
label_values(cloud_storage_request_count,region)
<strong><em><strong><em>_________________</em></strong></em></strong>_______________________</pre>

<p><strong>20. What is Grafana used for?</strong></p>

<p>Grafana is used for a variety of data visualisation use cases including but not limited to server monitoring, performance testing, windows host monitoring and Docker monitoring as well as for building metrics reporting dashboards in general.</p>

<p><strong>21. How do you create a Grafana dashboard?</strong></p>

<p>To create a Grafana dashboard you will want to navigate to the Grafana application after you have installed the platform and select the + icon from the top right-hand side menu. You should now see the option to select &ldquo;Add an empty panel&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Selecting this option will take you to the main dashboard configuration screen where you can start experimenting with different settings to create your first dashboard.</p>

<p><strong>24. How do you backup Grafana dashboards?</strong></p>

<p>In order to backup your Grafana dashboard you may wish to consider using an open-source tool such as the Grafana backup tool.</p>

<p>This tool uses a Python application to backup not only Grafana dashboards but also backups your settings, folder permissions and alert channel configurations. There is also the option to use a managed service such as the platform offered by Logit.io, which offers this service by default as part of our commitment to our users.</p>

<p><strong>25. How do you change the panel title in Grafana?</strong></p>

<p>To change the panel title of a chart/table in Grafana click the title of the panel and from the drop-down menu select &ldquo;edit&rdquo;.</p>

<p>From here you will notice a right-hand menu where you can directly change the panel title to a different name of your choice. Once you have typed a new name select &ldquo;apply&rdquo; to save your changes.</p>

<p><strong>26. How do you send data to Grafana?</strong></p>

<p>To forward data to Grafana from different data sources you will need to navigate to &ldquo;Data Sources&rdquo; from the configuration menu.</p>

<p>On this page, you will be able to view both previously configured sources as well as the option to add a new data source. When adding a new data source to Grafana you will be able to see detailed instructions for sending your specific data type within the platform.</p>

<p><strong>28. Where do you find the time filter in Grafana?</strong></p>

<p>The $timeFilter variable is used to drill down on insights captured between certain times. It can be found being used for log analysis and SQL querying.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some users have issues using this filter and so may need to use a workaround to distil the relevant information they are looking to display.</p>

<p><strong>29. How do you use the cURL command in Grafana?</strong></p>

<p>One example of a cURL command for Grafana looks like this; curl http://admin:admin@localhost:3000/api/search. This command performs a fetch of the dashboard for local installations of Grafana running with basic authentication enabled</p>
