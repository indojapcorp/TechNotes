<h2>How is GitLab different from GitHub?</h2>

<p>The major difference between GitHub and GitLab is&nbsp;the platform each philosophy presents. GitHub has higher availability and is more focused on infrastructure performance, while GitLab is more focused on offering a features-based system with a centralized, integrated platform for web developers.</p>

<h2>Why GitLab is better than Jenkins?</h2>

<p>GitLab provides more than what Jenkins is hoping to evolve to, by&nbsp;providing a fully integrated single application for the entire DevOps lifecycle. More than Jenkins&rsquo; goals, GitLab also provides planning, SCM, packaging, release, configuration, and monitoring (in addition to the CI/CD that Jenkins is focused on).</p>

<h2>Is GitLab better than Jira?</h2>

<p>While Jira is better for mid-sized teams who need specific things to test and track while developing code,&nbsp;GitLab is ideal&nbsp;for the largest teams out there who need features to improve their workflow.</p>

<h2>Is GitLab better than bitbucket?</h2>

<p>Summary. Atlassian Bitbucket gives teams Git code management, but also one place to plan projects, collaborate on code, test, and deploy. &hellip;&nbsp;<strong>GitLab</strong>&nbsp;is a complete DevOps platform, delivered as a single application, with built-in project management, source code management, CI/CD, monitoring and more.</p>

<h2>Why should I use GitLab?</h2>

<p>Why Use GitLab? The main benefit of using GitLab is that&nbsp;it allows all the team members to collaborate in every phase of the project. GitLab offers tracking from planning to creation to help developers automate the entire DevOps lifecycle and achieve the best possible results.</p>

<h2>What is the pipeline in GitLab?</h2>

<p>A pipeline is&nbsp;a group of jobs that get executed in stages. All of the jobs in a stage are executed in parallel (if there are enough concurrent Runners), and if they all succeed, the pipeline moves on to the next stage. If one of the jobs fails, the next stage is not (usually) executed.</p>

<h2>Is GitLab free for commercial use?</h2>

<p>Historically, GitLab was provided as two different software distributions, each with its own separate source code repository and documentation: Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE). &hellip; Enterprise Edition can be downloaded, installed, and run&nbsp;without a commercial subscription.</p>

<h2>What is the difference between fork and branch in GitLab?</h2>

<p>Forking creates a full copy of your repository, whereas branching only adds a branch to your existing tree. The file size of the branch can vary depending on the branch that you are on. Under the hood git readily accesses the different files and commits depending on what branch you are using.</p>

<h2>What is Project slug in GitLab?</h2>

<p>A repository slug is&nbsp;a URL-friendly version of a repository name, automatically generated by Bitbucket for use in the URL. For example, if your repository name was &lsquo;f&oslash;&oslash;bar&rsquo;, in the URL it would become &lsquo;foobar&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>Does GitLab have a GUI?</h2>

<p>But unlike Github,&nbsp;Gitlab does not have a Git GUI client of its own. A Git GUI client is the program that you install on your computer, that lets you control the workflow of your repository with graphical tools.</p>
