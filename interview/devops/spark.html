<h2>Q19. What do you understand by SchemaRDD?</h2>

<p>Ans. SchemaRDD is an RDD that consists of row objects (wrappers around the basic string or integer arrays) with schema information about the type of data in each column.</p>

<h2>Q20. What is a lazy evaluation in Spark?</h2>

<p>Ans. For large data in Spark, multiple operations take place even for the execution of a basic transformation. When a transformation is called on an RDD, the operation does not occur immediately. Transformations in Spark are not evaluated until you trigger an action. This is known as lazy evaluation. It avoids unnecessary memory and CPU usage that could take place due to certain mistakes.</p>

<p>Ans. To connect Spark with Mesos-</p>

<p>Configure the spark driver program to connect to Mesos.Install spark in the same location as that of Mesos and conf the property &#39;spark.mesos.executor.home&#39; to point to the location where it is installed.</p>

<h2>Q46. Why is there a need for broadcast variables when working with Apache Spark?</h2>

<p>Ans. These are read only variables, present in-memory cache on every machine. When working with Spark, usage of broadcast variables eliminates the necessity to ship copies of a variable for every task, so data can be processed faster. Broadcast variables help in storing a lookup table inside the memory which enhances the retrieval efficiency when compared to an RDD lookup ().</p>

<h2>Q47. Is it possible to run Spark and Mesos along with Hadoop?</h2>

<p>Ans. Yes, it is possible to run Spark and Mesos with Hadoop by launching each of these as a separate service on the machines. Mesos acts as a unified scheduler that assigns tasks to either Spark or Hadoop.</p>
