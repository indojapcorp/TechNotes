<p>4) What is AMI?<br />
AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image. It&rsquo;s a template that provides the information (an operating system, an application server, and applications) required to launch an instance, which is a copy of the AMI running as a virtual server in the cloud. You can launch instances from as many different AMIs as you need.</p>

<p>5) Mention what the relationship between an instance and AMI is?<br />
From a single AMI, you can launch multiple types of instances. An instance type defines the hardware of the host computer used for your instance.

Then stop your live instance and detach its root volume<br />
Note the unique device ID and attach that root volume to your new server<br />
And start it again</p>
