	<li>Identify essential goals associated with each role. Also, identifying the significant roles.</li>
	<li>Creating use cases for every goal associated for a use case template. This also includes maintaining the same abstraction level for the entire use case.&nbsp;Higher level use case steps are considered as goals for the lower level.</li>
	<li>Structuring the use cases</li>
	<li>Reviewing and validating the users</li>
</ul>

<h4>7. What is Scope creep and how can you avoid scope creep?</h4>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Scope creep, or requirement creep is a term that relates to the uncontrolled changes or deviation in the project&rsquo;s scope within the same resource range for example within same schedule and budget of the project.

<h4>49. Is there any difference between incremental and iterative development?</h4>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.<br />
In an iterative development software development happens without any interruption. Here the software development cycles which typically consists of sprint and release are repeated till the final product is obtained. Whereas, in an incremental model, software development follows the product design, implementation, and testing incrementally until the product is finished. Hence, it involves development and maintenance.</p>
