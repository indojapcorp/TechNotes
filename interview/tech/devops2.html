<h3>4. What are the different phases in DevOps?</h3>

<p>The various phases of the DevOps lifecycle are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Plan - Initially, there should be a plan for the type of application that needs to be developed. Getting a rough picture of the development process is always a good idea.</li>
	<li>Code - The application is coded as per the end-user requirements.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Build - Build the application by integrating various codes formed in the previous steps.</li>
	<li>Test - This is the most crucial step of the application development. Test the application and rebuild, if necessary.</li>
	<li>Integrate -&nbsp;Multiple codes from different programmers are integrated into one.</li>
	<li>Deploy - Code is deployed into a cloud environment for further usage. It is ensured that any new changes do not affect the functioning of a high traffic website.</li>
	<li>Operate - Operations are performed on the code if required.</li>
	<li>Monitor - Application performance is monitored. Changes are made to meet the end-user requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="DevOps Lifecycle" src="https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/assets/form_opacity.png" style="height:350px; width:840px" /></p>

<p>The above figure indicates the DevOps lifecycle.</p>

<h3>5. Mention some of the core benefits of DevOps.</h3>

<p>The core benefits of DevOps are as follows:</p>

<h4>Technical benefits</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Continuous software delivery</li>
	<li>Less complex problems to manage</li>
	<li>Early detection and faster correction of defects</li>
</ul>

<h4>Business benefits</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Faster delivery of features</li>
	<li>Stable operating environments</li>
	<li>Improved communication and collaboration between the teams</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. How will you approach a project that needs to implement DevOps?</h3>

<p>The following standard approaches can be used to implement DevOps in a specific project:</p>

<p>Stage 1</p>

<p>An assessment of the existing process and implementation for about two to three weeks to identify areas of improvement so that the team can create a road map for the implementation.</p>

<p>Stage 2</p>

<p>Create a proof of concept (PoC). Once it is accepted and approved, the team can start on the actual implementation and roll-out of the project plan.</p>

<p>Stage 3</p>

<p>The project is now ready for implementing DevOps by using version control/integration/testing/deployment/delivery and monitoring followed step by step.</p>

<p>By following the proper steps for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/devops-tutorial/version-control" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="version control">version control</a>, integration, testing, deployment, delivery, and monitoring, the project is now ready for DevOps implementation.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>7. What is the difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment?</h3>

	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Continuous Delivery</td>
			<td>Continuous Deployment</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Ensures code can be safely deployed on to production</td>
			<td>Every change that passes the automated tests is deployed to production automatically</td>

			<td>Delivers every change to a production-like environment through rigorous automated testing</td>
			<td>There is no explicit approval from a developer and requires a developed culture of monitoring</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

<h3>8. What is the role of configuration management in DevOps?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Enables management of and changes to multiple systems.</li>
	<li>Standardizes resource configurations, which in turn, manage IT infrastructure.</li>
	<li>It helps with the administration and management of multiple servers and maintains the integrity of the entire infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9. How does continuous monitoring help you maintain the entire architecture of the system?</h3>

<p>Continuous monitoring in DevOps is a process of detecting, identifying, and reporting any faults or threats in the entire infrastructure of the system.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ensures that all services, applications, and resources are running on the servers properly.</li>
	<li>Monitors the status of servers and determines if applications are working correctly or not.</li>
	<li>Enables continuous audit, transaction inspection, and controlled monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<h3>10. What is the role of AWS in DevOps?</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/introduction-to-amazon-web-services-aws-article" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="AWS">AWS</a>&nbsp;has the following role in DevOps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Flexible services -&nbsp;Provides ready-to-use, flexible services without the need to install or set up the software.</li>
	<li>Built for scale -&nbsp;You can manage a single instance or scale to thousands using AWS services.</li>
	<li>Automation -&nbsp;AWS lets you automate tasks and processes, giving you more time to innovate</li>
	<li>Secure -&nbsp;Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can set user permissions and policies.</li>
	<li>Large partner ecosystem -&nbsp;AWS supports a large ecosystem of partners that integrate with and extend AWS services.</li>
</ul>

<h3>11. Name three important DevOps KPIs.</h3>

<p>The three important KPIs are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Meantime to failure recovery - This is the average time taken to recover from a failure.</li>
	<li>Deployment frequency -&nbsp;The frequency in which the deployment occurs.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Percentage of failed deployments -&nbsp;The number of times the deployment fails.</li>
</ul>

<h3>12. Explain the term &quot;Infrastructure as Code&quot; (IaC) as it relates to configuration management.</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Writing code to manage configuration, deployment, and automatic provisioning.</li>
	<li>Managing data centers with machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration.</li>
	<li>Ensuring all your servers and other infrastructure components are provisioned consistently and effortlessly.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Administering cloud computing environments, also known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/saas-paas-iaas-quick-comparison-article" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="infrastructure as a service (IaaS).">infrastructure as a service (IaaS).</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>13. How is IaC implemented using AWS?</h3>

<p>Start by talking about the age-old mechanisms of writing commands onto script files and testing them in a separate environment before deployment and how this approach is being replaced by IaC. Similar to the codes written for other services, with the help of AWS, IaC allows developers to write, test, and maintain infrastructure entities in a descriptive manner, using formats such as JSON or YAML. This enables easier development and faster deployment of infrastructure changes.</p>

<h3>14. Why Has DevOps Gained Prominence over the Last Few Years?</h3>

<p>Before talking about the growing popularity of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/devops-tutorial/what-is-devops" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="DevOps">DevOps</a>, discuss the current industry scenario. Begin with some examples of how big players such as&nbsp;<a href="https://techbeacon.com/10-companies-killing-it-devops" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Netflix and Facebook">Netflix and Facebook</a>&nbsp;are investing in DevOps to automate and accelerate application deployment and how this has helped them grow their business. Using Facebook as an example, you would point to Facebook&rsquo;s continuous deployment and code ownership models and how these have helped it scale up but ensure the quality of experience at the same time. Hundreds of lines of code are implemented without affecting quality, stability, and security.</p>

<p>Your next use case should be Netflix. This streaming and on-demand video company follow similar practices with fully automated processes and systems. Mention the user base of these two organizations: Facebook has 2 billion users while Netflix streams online content to more than 100 million users worldwide.</p>

<p>These are great examples of how DevOps can help organizations to ensure higher success rates for releases, reduce the lead time between bug fixes, streamline and continuous delivery through automation, and an overall reduction in manpower costs.</p>

<p>We will now look into the next set of DevOps Interview Questions that includes - Git, Selenium, Jenkins.</p>

<h3>15. What are the fundamental differences between DevOps &amp; Agile?</h3>

<h3>16. What are the anti-patterns of DevOps?</h3>

<p>Patterns are common practices that are usually followed by organizations. An anti-pattern is formed when an organization continues to blindly follow a pattern adopted by others but does not work for them. Some of the myths about DevOps include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cannot perform DevOps &rarr; Have the wrong people</li>
	<li>DevOps &rArr; Production Management is done by developers</li>
	<li>The solution to all the organization&rsquo;s problems &rArr; DevOps</li>
	<li>DevOps == Process&nbsp;</li>
	<li>DevOps == Agile</li>
	<li>Cannot perform DevOps &rarr; Organization is unique</li>
	<li>A separate group needs to be made for DevOps</li>
</ul>

<h3>17. What are the benefits of using version control?</h3>

<p>Here are the benefits of using Version Control:</p>

<ul>
	<li>All team members are free to work on any file at any time with the Version Control System (VCS). Later on, VCS will allow the team to integrate all of the modifications into a single version.</li>
	<li>The VCS asks to provide a brief summary of what was changed every time we save a new version of the project. We also get to examine exactly what was modified in the content of the file. As a result, we will be able to see who made what changes to the project.</li>
	<li>Inside the VCS, all the previous variants and versions are properly stored. We will be able to request any version at any moment, and we will be able to retrieve a snapshot of the entire project at our fingertips.</li>
	<li>A VCS that is distributed, such as Git, lets all the team members retrieve a complete history of the project. This allows developers or other stakeholders to use the local Git repositories of any of the teammates even if the main server goes down at any point in time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>18. Describe the branching strategies you have used.</h3>

<p>To test our knowledge of the purpose of branching and our experience of branching at a past job, this question is usually asked.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Below topics can help in answering this DevOps interview question -</p>

<ul>
	<li>Release branching - We can clone the develop branch to create a Release branch once it has enough functionality for a release. This branch kicks off the next release cycle, thus no new features can be contributed beyond this point. The things that can be contributed are documentation generation, bug fixing, and other release-related tasks. The release is merged into master and given a version number once it is ready to ship. It should also be merged back into the development branch, which may have evolved since the initial release.</li>
	<li>Feature branching - This branching model maintains all modifications for a specific feature contained within a branch. The branch gets merged into master once the feature has been completely tested and approved by using tests that are automated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Task branching - In this branching model, every task is implemented in its respective branch. The task key is mentioned in the branch name. We need to simply look at the task key in the branch name to discover which code implements which task.</p>

<h3>19. Can you explain the &ldquo;Shift left to reduce failure&rdquo; concept in DevOps?</h3>

<p>Shift left is a DevOps idea for improving security, performance, and other factors. Let us take an example: if we look at all of the processes in DevOps, we can state that security is tested prior to the deployment step. We can add security in the development phase, which is on the left, by employing the left shift method. [will be depicted in a diagram] We can integrate with all phases, including before development and during testing, not just development. This most likely raises the security level by detecting faults at an early stage.</p>

<h3>20. What is the Blue/Green Deployment Pattern?</h3>

<p>This is a method of continuous deployment that is commonly used to reduce downtime. This is where traffic is transferred from one instance to another. In order to include a fresh version of code, we must replace the old code with a new code version.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new version exists in a green environment and the old version exists in a blue environment. After making changes to the previous version, we need a new instance from the old one to execute a newer version of the instance.</p>

<h3>21. What is Continuous Testing?</h3>

<p>Continuous Testing constitutes the running of automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline to provide instant feedback on the business risks present in the most recent release. In order to prevent problems in step-switching in the Software delivery life-cycle and to allow Development teams to receive immediate feedback, every build is continually tested in this manner. This results in significant increase in speed in a developer&#39;s productivity as it eliminates the requirement for re-running all the tests after each update and project re-building.</p>

<h3>22. What is Automation Testing?</h3>

<p>Test automation or manual testing Automation is the process of automating a manual procedure in order to test an application or system.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/what-is-automation-testing-article" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Automation testing">Automation testing</a>&nbsp;entails the use of independent testing tools that allow you to develop test scripts that can be run repeatedly without the need for human interaction.</p>

<h3>23. What are the benefits of Automation Testing?</h3>

<p>Some of the advantages of Automation Testing are -</p>

<ul>
	<li>Helps to save money and time.</li>
	<li>Unattended execution can be easily done.</li>
	<li>Huge test matrices can be easily tested.</li>
	<li>Parallel execution is enabled.</li>
	<li>Reduced human-generated errors, which results in improved accuracy.</li>
	<li>Repeated test tasks execution is supported.</li>
</ul>

<h3>24. How to automate Testing in the DevOps lifecycle?</h3>

<p>Developers are obliged to commit all source code changes to a shared DevOps repository.</p>

<p>Every time a change is made in the code, Jenkins-like Continuous Integration tools will grab it from this common repository and deploy it for Continuous Testing, which is done by tools like Selenium.</p>

<h3>25. Why is Continuous Testing important for DevOps?</h3>

<p>Any modification to the code may be tested immediately with Continuous Testing. This prevents concerns like quality issues and release delays that might occur whenever big-bang testing is delayed until the end of the cycle. In this way, Continuous Testing allows for high-quality and more frequent releases.</p>

<h3>26. What are the key elements of Continuous Testing tools?</h3>

<p>Continuous Testing key elements are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Test Optimization - It guarantees that tests produce reliable results and actionable information. Test Data Management, Test Optimization Management, and Test Maintenance are examples of aspects.</li>
	<li>Advanced Analysis - In order to avoid problems from occurring in the first place and to achieve more within each iteration, it employs automation in areas like scope assessment/prioritization, changes effect analysis, and static code analysis.</li>
	<li>Policy Analysis - It guarantees that all processes are in line with the organization&#39;s changing business needs and that all compliance requirements are met.</li>
	<li>Risk Assessment - Test coverage optimization, technical debt, risk mitigation duties, and quality evaluation are all covered to guarantee the build is ready to move on to the next stage.</li>
	<li>Service Virtualization - Ensures that real-world testing scenarios are available. Service visualisation provides access to a virtual representation of the needed testing phases, ensuring its availability and reducing the time spent setting up the test environment.</li>
	<li>Requirements Traceability - It guarantees that no rework is necessary and real criteria are met. To determine which needs require additional validation, are in jeopardy and performing as expected, an object evaluation is used.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DevOps Interview Questions for Source Code Management &mdash; Git</h2>

<h3>27. Explain the difference between a centralized and distributed version control system (VCS).</h3>

<h4>Centralized Version Control System</h4>

<ul>
	<li>All file versions are stored on a central server</li>
	<li>No developer has a copy of all files on a local system</li>
	<li>If the central server crashes, all data from the project will be lost</li>
</ul>

<h4>Distributed Control System</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Every developer has a copy of all versions of the code on their systems</li>
	<li>Enables team members to work offline and does not rely on a single location for backups</li>
	<li>There is no threat, even if the server crashes</li>
</ul>

<h3>28. What is the git command that downloads any repository from GitHub to your computer?</h3>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/git-tutorial/git-commands" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="git command">git command</a>&nbsp;that downloads any repository from GitHub to your computer is&nbsp;git clone.</p>

<h3>29. How do you push a file from your local system to the GitHub repository using Git?</h3>

<p>First, connect the local repository to your remote repository:</p>

<p>git remote add origin [copied web address]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>// Ex: git remote add origin&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Simplilearn-github/test.git" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/Simplilearn-github/test.git">https://github.com/Simplilearn-github/test.git</a></p>

<p>Second, push your file to the remote repository:</p>

<p>git push origin master</p>

<h3>30. How is a bare repository different from the standard way of initializing a Git repository?</h3>

<p>Using the standard method:</p>

<h4>git init</h4>

<ul>
	<li>You create a working directory with git init</li>
	<li>A .git subfolder is created with all the git-related revision history</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the bare way</p>

<h4>git init --bare</h4>

<ul>
	<li>It does not contain any working or checked out a copy of source files</li>
	<li>Bare repositories store git revision history in the root folder of your repository, instead of the .git subfolder</li>
</ul>

<h3>31. Which of the following CLI commands can be used to rename files?</h3>

<ol>
	<li>git rm</li>
	<li>git mv</li>
	<li>git rm -r</li>
	<li>None of the above</li>
</ol>

<p>The correct answer is&nbsp;B) git mv</p>

<h3>32. What is the process for reverting a commit that has already been pushed and made public?</h3>

<p>There are two ways that you can revert a commit:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Remove or fix the bad file in a new commit and push it to the remote repository. Then commit it to the remote repository using:<br />
	<br />
	git commit &ndash;m &quot;commit message&quot;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Create a new commit that undoes all the changes that were made in the bad commit. Use the following command:<br />
	<br />
	git revert &lt;commit id&gt;</li>
</ol>

<p>Example: git revert 56de0938f</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>33. Explain the difference between git fetch and git pull.</h3>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Git fetch</td>
			<td>Git pull</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Git fetch only downloads new data from a remote repository</td>
			<td>Git pull updates the current HEAD branch with the latest changes from the remote server</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Does not integrate any new data into your working files</td>
			<td>Downloads new data and integrate it with the current working files</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Users can run a Git fetch at any time to update the remote-tracking branches</td>
			<td>Tries to merge remote changes with your local ones</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Command -&nbsp;git fetch origin</p>

			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; git fetch &ndash;-all</p>
			</td>
			<td>Command -&nbsp;git pull origin master</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>34. What is Git stash?</h3>

<p>A developer working with a current branch wants to switch to another branch to work on something else, but the developer doesn&#39;t want to commit changes to your unfinished work. The solution to this issue is Git stash. Git stash takes your modified tracked files and saves them on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/git_stash.png" style="height:271px; width:900px" /></p>

<h3>35. Explain the concept of branching in Git.</h3>

<p>Suppose you are working on an application, and you want to add a new feature to the app. You can create a new branch and build the new feature on that branch.</p>

<ul>
	<li>By default, you always work on the master branch</li>
	<li>The circles on the branch represent various commits made on the branch</li>
	<li>After you are done with all the changes, you can merge it with the master branch</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/git_branching.png" style="height:165px; width:503px" /></p>

<h3>36. What is the difference between Git Merge and Git Rebase?</h3>

<p>Suppose you are working on a new feature in a dedicated branch, and another team member updates the master branch with new commits. You can use these two functions:</p>

<p>Git Merge</p>

<p>To incorporate the new commits into your feature branch, use Git merge.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Creates an extra merge commit every time you need to incorporate changes</li>
	<li>But, it pollutes your feature branch history</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="Git Merge" src="https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/git_merge.png" style="height:260px; width:514px" /></p>

<p>Git Rebase</p>

<p>As an alternative to merging, you can rebase the feature branch on to master.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Incorporates all the new commits in the master branch</li>
	<li>It creates new commits for every commit in the original branch and rewrites project history</li>
</ul>

<h3>37. How do you find a list of files that have been changed in a particular commit?</h3>

<p>The command to get a list of files that have been changed in a particular commit is:</p>

<p>git diff-tree &ndash;r {commit hash}</p>

<p>Example: git diff-tree &ndash;r 87e673f21b</p>

<ul>
	<li>-r flag instructs the command to list individual files</li>
	<li>commit hash will list all the files that were changed or added in that commit</li>
</ul>

<h3>38. What is a merge conflict in Git, and how can it be resolved?</h3>

<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/git-tutorial/merge-conflicts-in-git" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Git merge conflict">Git merge conflict</a>&nbsp;happens when you have merge branches with competing for commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.</p>

<p>Manually edit the conflicted file to select the changes that you want to keep in the final merge.</p>

<p>Resolve using GitHub conflict editor</p>

<p>This is done when a merge conflict is caused after competing for line changes. For example, this may occur when people make different changes to the same line of the same file on different branches in your Git repository.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Resolving a merge conflict using conflict editor:</li>
	<li>Under your repository name, click &quot;Pull requests.&quot;</li>
	<li>In the &quot;Pull requests&quot; drop-down, click the pull request with a merge conflict that you&#39;d like to resolve</li>
	<li>Near the bottom of your pull request, click &quot;Resolve conflicts.&quot;</li>
	<li>Decide if you only want to keep your branch&#39;s changes, the other branch&#39;s changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches.</li>
	<li>Delete the conflict markers&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;and make changes you want in the final merge.</li>
	<li>If you have more than one merge conflict in your file, scroll down to the next set of conflict markers and repeat steps four and five to resolve your merge conflict.</li>
	<li>Once you have resolved all the conflicts in the file, click&nbsp;Mark as resolved.</li>
	<li>If you have more than one file with a conflict, select the next file you want to edit on the left side of the page under &quot;conflicting files&quot; and repeat steps four to seven until you&#39;ve resolved all of your pull request&#39;s merge conflicts.</li>
	<li>Once you&#39;ve resolved your merge conflicts, click&nbsp;Commit merge. This merges the entire base branch into your head branch.</li>
	<li>To merge your pull request, click Merge pull request.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A merge conflict is resolved using the command line.</li>
	<li>Open Git Bash.</li>
	<li>Navigate into the local Git repository that contains the merge conflict.</li>
	<li>Generate a list of the files that the merge conflict affects. In this example, the file styleguide.md has a merge conflict.</li>
	<li>Open any text editor, such as Sublime Text or Atom, and navigate to the file that has merge conflicts.</li>
	<li>To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;. &quot; Open it, and you&#39;ll see the changes from the base branch after the line &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD.&quot;</li>
	<li>Next, you&#39;ll see &quot;=======&quot;, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BRANCH-NAME&quot;.</li>
	<li>Decide if you only want to keep your branch&#39;s changes, the other branch&#39;s changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches.</li>
	<li>Delete the conflict markers &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;, &quot;=======&quot;, &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; and make the changes you want in the final merge.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this example, both the changes are incorporated into the final merge:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Add or stage your changes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Commit your changes with a comment.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now you can merge the branches on the command line, or push your changes to your remote repository on GitHub and merge your changes in a&nbsp;pull request.</p>

<h3>39. What is Git bisect? How can you use it to determine the source of a (regression) bug?</h3>

<p>Git bisect is a tool that uses binary search to locate the commit that triggered a bug.</p>

<p>Git bisect command -</p>

<p>git bisect &lt;subcommand&gt; &lt;options&gt;</p>

<p>The git bisect command is used in finding the bug performing commit in the project by using a binary search algorithm.</p>

<p>The bug occurring commit is called the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; commit, and the commit before the bug occurring one is called the &ldquo;good&rdquo; commit. We convey the same to the git bisect tool, and it picks a random commit between the two endpoints and prompts whether that one is the &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; one. The process continues uptil the range is narrowed down and the exact commit that introduced the exact change is discovered.</p>

	<li>Create an empty file called&nbsp;&lt;plugin&gt;.hpi.pinned</li>
	<li>Restart Jenkins&nbsp;and use your custom build of a core plugin</li>
</ul>

<h3>51. How can you temporarily turn off Jenkins security if the administrative users have locked themselves out of the admin console?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>When security is enabled, the&nbsp;Config&nbsp;file contains an XML element named&nbsp;useSecurity&nbsp;that will be set to&nbsp;true.</li>
	<li>By changing this setting to&nbsp;false, security will be disabled the next time Jenkins is restarted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>52. What are the ways in which a build can be scheduled/run in Jenkins?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>By source code management commits.</li>
	<li>After completion of other builds.</li>
	<li>Scheduled to run at a specified time.</li>
	<li>Manual build requests.</li>
</ul>

<h3>53. What are the commands that you can use to restart Jenkins manually?</h3>

It may be used to debug tests, alter and record and is also available as a Firefox extension. Selenium IDE comes with the whole Selenium Core that&nbsp; allows us to rapidly and easily replay and record&nbsp; tests in the exact environment where they will be conducted.</p>

<p>Selenium IDE is the best environment for building Selenium tests, regardless of the style of testing we prefer, thanks to the ability to move instructions around rapidly and the autocomplete support.</p>

<h3>66. What is the difference between Assert and Verify commands in Selenium?</h3>

<p>The difference between Verify and Assert commands in Selenium are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The verify commands determine whether or not the provided condition is true. The program execution does not halt regardless of whether the condition is true or not, i.e., all test steps will be completed, and verification failure will not stop the execution.</li>
	<li>The assert command determines whether a condition is false or true. To know whether the supplied element is on the page or not, we do the following. The next test step will be performed by the program control, if the condition is true. However, no further tests will be run, and the execution will halt, if the condition is false.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DevOps Interview Questions for Configuration Management &mdash; Chef, Puppet, Ansible</h2>

<h3>69. Why are SSL certificates used in Chef?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>SSL certificates are used between the Chef server and the client to ensure that each node has access to the right data.</li>
	<li>Every node has a private and public key pair. The public key is stored at the Chef server.</li>
	<li>When an SSL certificate is sent to the server, it will contain the private key of the node.</li>
	<li>The server compares this against the public key in order to identify the node and give the node access to the required data.</li>
</ul>

	<li>Version control takes the support of Git and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/puppet-tutorial/what-is-puppet" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Puppet's">Puppet&#39;s</a>&nbsp;code manager app.</li>
	<li>The changes are also passed through Jenkin&#39;s continuous integration pipeline.</li>
</ul>

<h3>75. What are the resources in Puppet?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Resources are the basic units of any configuration management tool.</li>
	<li>These are the features of a node, like their software packages or services.</li>
	<li>A resource declaration, written in a catalog, describes the action to be performed on or with the resource.</li>
	<li>When the catalog is executed, it sets the node to the desired state.</li>
</ul>

<h3>76. What is a class in Puppet?</h3>

<p>Classes are named blocks in your manifest that configure various functionalities of the node, such as services, files, and packages.</p>

<p>The classes are added to a node&#39;s catalog and are executed only when explicitly invoked.</p>

<p>Class apache (String $version = &lsquo;latest&rsquo;) {</p>

<p>package{</p>

<p>&lsquo;httpd&rsquo;: ensure =&gt; $version,</p>

<p>before =&gt; File[&lsquo;/etc/httpd.conf&rsquo;],}</p>

<h3>77. What is an Ansible role?</h3>

<p>An Ansible role is an independent block of tasks, variables, files, and templates embedded inside a playbook.</p>

<p>This playbook installs tomcat on node1.</p>

<h3>78. When should I use &#39;{{ }}&#39;?</h3>

<p>Always use {{}} for variables, unless you have a conditional statement, such as &quot;when: &hellip;&quot;. This is because conditional statements are run through Jinja, which resolves the expressions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;For example:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;echo &ldquo;This prints the value of {{foo}}&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;when : foo is defined</p>

<p>Using brackets makes it simpler to distinguish between strings and undefined variables.</p>

<p>This also ensures that Ansible doesn&#39;t recognize the line as a dictionary declaration.</p>

<h3>79. What is the best way to make content reusable/redistributable?</h3>

<p>There are three ways to make content reusable or redistributable in Ansible:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Roles are used to managing tasks in a playbook. They can be easily shared via Ansible Galaxy.</li>
	<li>&quot;include&quot; is used to add a submodule or another file to a playbook. This means a code written once can be added to multiple playbooks.</li>
	<li>&quot;import&quot; is an improvement of &quot;include,&quot; which ensures that a file is added only once. This is helpful when a line is run recursively.</li>
</ul>

<h3>80. How is Ansible different from Puppet?</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is possible to share&nbsp;<a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/devops-tutorial/kubernetes-vs-docker" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Docker">Docker</a>&nbsp;containers on different nodes with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/docker-tutorial/docker-swarm" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Docker Swarm">Docker Swarm</a>.</li>
	<li>Docker Swarm is a tool that allows IT administrators and developers to create and manage a cluster of swarm nodes within the Docker platform.</li>
	<li>A swarm consists of two types of nodes: a manager node and a worker node.</li>
</ul>

<h3>84. What are the commands used to create a Docker swarm?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Create a swarm where you want to run your manager node.<br />
	<br />
	Docker swarm init --advertise-addr &lt;MANAGER-IP&gt;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Once you&#39;ve created a swarm on your manager node, you can add worker nodes to your swarm.</li>
	<li>When a node is initialized as a manager, it immediately creates a token. In order to create a worker node, the following command (token) should be executed on the host machine of a worker node.<br />
	<br />
	docker swarm join \ --token SWMTKN-1-49nj1cmql0jkz5s954yi3oex3nedyz0fb0xx14ie39trti4wxv-8vxv8rssmk743ojnwacrr2e7c \ 192.168.99.100:2377</li>
</ul>

<h3>85. How do you run multiple containers using a single service?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>It is possible to run multiple containers as a single service with Docker Compose.</li>
	<li>Here, each container runs in isolation but can interact with each other.</li>
	<li>All Docker Compose files are YAML files.</li>
</ul>

<h3>86. What is a Dockerfile used for?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>A Dockerfile is used for creating Docker images using the build command.</li>
	<li>With a Docker image, any user can run the code to create Docker containers.</li>
	<li>Once a Docker image is built, it&#39;s uploaded in a Docker registry.</li>
	<li>From the Docker registry, users can get the Docker image and build new containers whenever they want.</li>
</ul>

<h3>87. Explain the differences between Docker images and Docker containers.</h3>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Docker Images&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Docker Container</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Docker images are templates of Docker containers</td>
			<td>Containers are runtime instances of a Docker image</td>

		<tr>
			<td>The image layer is a read-only filesystem</td>
			<td>Every container layer is a read-write filesystem</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>88. Instead of YAML, what can you use as an alternate file for building Docker compose?</h3>

<p>To build a Docker compose, a user can use a JSON file instead of YAML. In case a user wants to use a JSON file, he/she should specify the filename as given:</p>

<p>Docker-compose -f Docker-compose.json up</p>

<p>89. How do you create a Docker container?</p>

<p>Task: Create a MySQL Docker container&nbsp;</p>

<p>A user can either build a Docker image or pull an existing Docker image (like MySQL) from Docker Hub.</p>

<p>Now, Docker creates a new container&nbsp;MySQL&nbsp;from the existing Docker image. Simultaneously, the container layer of the read-write filesystem is also created on top of the image layer.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Command to create a Docker container:&nbsp;Docker run -t &ndash;i MySQL&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Command to list down the running containers:&nbsp;Docker ps</li>
</ul>

<h3>90. What is the difference between a registry and a repository?</h3>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Registry</td>
			<td>Repository</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>A Docker registry is an open-source server-side service used for hosting and distributing Docker images</td>
			<td>The repository is a collection of multiple versions of Docker images&nbsp;</td>

<p>Now, let&#39;s have a look at the DevOps interview questions for continuous monitoring.</p>

<h2>DevOps Interview Questions for Continuous Monitoring</h2>

<h3>93. How does Nagios help in the continuous monitoring of systems, applications, and services?</h3>

<p>Nagios enables server monitoring and the ability to check if they are sufficiently utilized or if any task failures need to be addressed.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Verifies the status of the servers and services</li>
	<li>Inspects the health of your infrastructure</li>
	<li>Checks if applications are working correctly and web servers are reachable</li>
</ul>

<h3>94. How does Nagios help in the continuous monitoring of systems, applications, and services?</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>95. What do you mean by Nagios Remote Plugin Executor (NPRE) of Nagios?</h3>

<p>Nagios Remote Plugin Executor (NPRE) enables you to execute Nagios plugins on Linux/Unix machines. You can monitor remote machine metrics (disk usage, CPU load, etc.)</p>

<ul>
	<li>The&nbsp;check_npre&nbsp;plugin that resides on the local monitoring machine</li>
	<li>The&nbsp;NPRE&nbsp;daemon that runs on the remote Linux/Unix machine</li>
</ul>

<h3>96. What are the port numbers that Nagios uses for monitoring purposes?</h3>

<p>Usually, Nagios uses the following port numbers for monitoring:</p>

<h3>97. What are active and passive checks in Nagios?</h3>

<p>Nagios is capable of monitoring hosts and services in two ways:</p>

<h4>Actively</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Active checks are initiated as a result of the Nagios process</li>
	<li>Active checks are regularly scheduled</li>
</ul>

<h4>Passively</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Passive checks are initiated and performed through external applications/processes</li>
	<li>Passive checks results are submitted to Nagios for processing</li>
</ul>

<h3>98. What are active and passive checks in Nagios?</h3>

<p>Active Checks:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The check logic in the Nagios daemon initiates active checks.</li>
	<li>Nagios will execute a plugin and pass the information on what needs to be checked.</li>
	<li>The plugin will then check the operational state of the host or service, and report results back to the Nagios daemon.</li>
	<li>It will process the results of the host or service check and send notifications.</li>
</ul>

<p>Passive Checks:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In passive checks, an external application checks the status of a host or service.</li>
	<li>It writes the results of the check to the external command file.</li>
	<li>Nagios reads the external command file and places the results of all passive checks into a queue for later processing.</li>
	<li>Nagios may send out notifications, log alerts, etc. depending on the check result information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>99. Explain the main configuration file and its location in Nagios.</h3>

<p>The main configuration file consists of several directives that affect how Nagios operates. The Nagios process and the CGIs read the config file.</p>

<p>A sample main configuration file will be placed into your settings&nbsp;directory:</p>

<p>/usr/local/Nagios/etc/resource.cfg</p>

<h3>100. What is the Nagios Network Analyzer?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>It provides an in-depth look at all network traffic sources and security threats.</li>
	<li>It provides a central view of your network traffic and bandwidth data.</li>
	<li>It allows system admins to gather high-level information on the health of the network.</li>
	<li>It enables you to be proactive in resolving outages, abnormal behavior, and threats before they affect critical business processes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>101. What are the benefits of HTTP and SSL certificate monitoring with Nagios?</h3>

<p>HTTP certificate monitoring</p>

<ul>
	<li>Increased server, services, and application availability.</li>
	<li>Fast detection of network outages and protocol failures.</li>
	<li>Enables web transaction and web server performance monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<p>SSL certificate monitoring</p>

<ul>
	<li>Increased website availability.</li>
	<li>Frequent application availability.</li>
	<li>It provides increased security.</li>
</ul>

<h3>102. Explain virtualization with Nagios.</h3>

<p>Nagios can run on different virtualization platforms, like VMware, Microsoft Visual PC, Xen, Amazon EC2, etc.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Provides the capabilities to monitor an assortment of metrics on different platforms</li>
	<li>Ensures quick detection of service and application failures</li>
	<li>Has the ability to monitor the following metrics:</li>
	<li>CPU Usage</li>
	<li>Memory</li>
	<li>Networking</li>
	<li>VM status</li>
	<li>Reduced administrative overhead</li>
</ul>

<h3>103. Name the three variables that affect recursion and inheritance in Nagios.</h3>

<p>name - Template name that can be referenced in other object definitions so it can inherit the object&#39;s properties/variables.</p>

<p>use - Here, you specify the name of the template object that you</p>

<p>want to inherit properties/variables from.</p>

<p>register - This variable indicates whether or not the object definition</p>

<p>should be registered with Nagios.</p>

<p>define someobjecttype{</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;object-specific variables &hellip;.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;name template_name</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;use name_of_template</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;register [0/1]</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>

<h3>104. Why is Nagios said to be object-oriented?</h3>

<p>Using the object configuration format, you can create object definitions that inherit properties from other object definitions. Hence, Nagios is known as object-oriented.</p>

<p>Types of Objects:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Services</li>
	<li>Hosts</li>
	<li>Commands</li>
	<li>Time Periods</li>
</ul>

<h3>105. Explain what state stalking is in Nagios.</h3>

<ul>
	<li>State stalking is used for logging purposes in Nagios.</li>
	<li>When stalking is enabled for a particular host or service, Nagios will watch that host or service very carefully.</li>
	<li>It will log any changes it sees in the output of check results.</li>
	<li>This helps in the analysis of log files.</li>
</ul>
