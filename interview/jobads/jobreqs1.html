You will take personal ownership of influencing Customer technology decisions to minimize program risk. You will work collaboratively with key stakeholders at Guidewire such as Customer Success Managers, Support and Product Management. You will also work closely with our SI partners. Your goal is to delivery technical leadership, create confidence, and build trusted relationships with our most complex customers.</p>
