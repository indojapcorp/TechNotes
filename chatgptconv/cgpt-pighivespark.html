<p>Code Apache Pig script to process log<br />
Sure, here&#39;s an example Apache Pig script to process log data:</p>

<p>sql<br />
Copy code<br />
-- Load the log data into a relation<br />
logs = LOAD &#39;log_data.txt&#39; USING PigStorage(&#39;,&#39;) AS (ip:chararray, date:chararray, method:chararray, url:chararray, status:int, size:int);</p>

<p>-- Filter out any records with a status code of 404<br />
logs_filtered = FILTER logs BY status != 404;</p>

<p>-- Group the records by IP address and count the number of requests for each IP<br />
ip_counts = GROUP logs_filtered BY ip;<br />
ip_counts = FOREACH ip_counts GENERATE group AS ip, COUNT(logs_filtered) AS requests;</p>

<p>-- Order the results by the number of requests in descending order<br />
ip_counts_ordered = ORDER ip_counts BY requests DESC;</p>

<p>-- Store the results in a file<br />
STORE ip_counts_ordered INTO &#39;ip_counts.txt&#39; USING PigStorage(&#39;,&#39;);<br />
This script assumes that the log data is in a file called log_data.txt and that each line of the file contains comma-separated values representing the IP address, date, HTTP method, URL, status code, and size of a log entry.</p>

<p>The script first loads the log data into a relation called logs. It then filters out any records with a status code of 404 using the FILTER operator and stores the filtered records in a relation called logs_filtered.</p>

<p>Next, the script groups the filtered records by IP address using the GROUP operator and counts the number of requests for each IP using the COUNT function. The results are stored in a relation called ip_counts.</p>

<p>The script then orders the results by the number of requests in descending order using the ORDER operator and stores the results in a file called ip_counts.txt using the STORE operator.</p>

<p>sql<br />
Copy code<br />
-- Create a table to store the log data<br />
CREATE TABLE logs (<br />
&nbsp; ip STRING,<br />

This script assumes that the log data is in a file called log_data.txt located in HDFS at hdfs://localhost:9000/.</p>

<p>The script first creates a table called logs to store the log data. It then loads the log data from the file into the logs table using the LOAD DATA statement.</p>

<p>Next, the script creates a table called logs_filtered to store the filtered log data, which excludes any records with a status code of 404. This is done using a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause.</p>

<p>The script then creates a table called ip_counts to store the aggregated data, which counts the number of requests for each IP address. This is done using a SELECT statement with a GROUP BY clause.</p>

<p>The script then creates a table called ip_counts_ordered to store the ordered results. This is done using a SELECT statement with an ORDER BY clause.</p>

<p>Finally, the script stores the results in a local file called ip_counts.txt using the INSERT OVERWRITE statement with a SELECT statement that retrieves the data from the ip_counts_ordered table and writes it to the file.</p>

<strong>Question</strong><br />
ETL use case using Apache Spark<br />
Sure! Here&#39;s an ETL use case using Apache Spark:</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you have a large dataset of sales transactions stored in CSV format on HDFS. The dataset contains the following columns:</p>

<p>transaction_id: The ID of the transaction<br />
customer_id: The ID of the customer who made the purchase<br />
product_id: The ID of the product being purchased<br />
quantity: The quantity of the product being purchased<br />
price: The price of the product being purchased<br />
timestamp: The timestamp of the transaction<br />
You want to perform some ETL operations on this dataset to transform it and load it into a data warehouse. Specifically, you want to:</p>

<p>Filter out any transactions with missing or invalid data.<br />
Calculate the total revenue generated by each product.<br />
Calculate the total revenue generated by each customer.<br />
Load the transformed data into a database table.<br />
Here&#39;s how you can achieve this using Apache Spark:</p>

<p>python<br />
Copy code<br />
# Import necessary modules<br />
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession<br />
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, sum</p>

<p># Create a Spark session<br />
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(&#39;SalesDataETL&#39;).getOrCreate()</p>

<p># Load the sales data from HDFS into a DataFrame<br />
sales_data = spark.read.csv(&#39;hdfs://localhost:9000/sales_data.csv&#39;, header=True, inferSchema=True)</p>

<p># Filter out any transactions with missing or invalid data<br />
sales_data_filtered = sales_data.filter(col(&#39;transaction_id&#39;).isNotNull() &amp; col(&#39;customer_id&#39;).isNotNull() &amp; col(&#39;product_id&#39;).isNotNull() &amp; col(&#39;quantity&#39;).isNotNull() &amp; col(&#39;price&#39;).isNotNull() &amp; col(&#39;timestamp&#39;).isNotNull())</p>

<p># Calculate the total revenue generated by each product<br />
product_revenue = sales_data_filtered.groupBy(&#39;product_id&#39;).agg(sum(col(&#39;quantity&#39;) * col(&#39;price&#39;)).alias(&#39;total_revenue&#39;))</p>

<p># Calculate the total revenue generated by each customer<br />
customer_revenue = sales_data_filtered.groupBy(&#39;customer_id&#39;).agg(sum(col(&#39;quantity&#39;) * col(&#39;price&#39;)).alias(&#39;total_revenue&#39;))</p>

<p># Load the transformed data into a database table<br />
product_revenue.write.format(&#39;jdbc&#39;).options(url=&#39;jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sales_data&#39;, driver=&#39;com.mysql.jdbc.Driver&#39;, dbtable=&#39;product_revenue&#39;, user=&#39;username&#39;, password=&#39;password&#39;).mode(&#39;overwrite&#39;).save()<br />
customer_revenue.write.format(&#39;jdbc&#39;).options(url=&#39;jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sales_data&#39;, driver=&#39;com.mysql.jdbc.Driver&#39;, dbtable=&#39;customer_revenue&#39;, user=&#39;username&#39;, password=&#39;password&#39;).mode(&#39;overwrite&#39;).save()</p>

<p># Stop the Spark session<br />
spark.stop()<br />
This script performs the following steps:</p>

<p>It creates a Spark session using the SparkSession module.<br />
It loads the sales data from HDFS into a DataFrame using the read.csv() method.<br />
It filters out any transactions with missing or invalid data using the filter() method and the isNotNull() function.<br />
It calculates the total revenue generated by each product and each customer using the groupBy() method and the agg() function with the sum() function.<br />
It loads the transformed data into a database table using the write() method with the jdbc format and the appropriate options for the database connection.<br />
It stops the Spark session using the stop() method.<br />
This ETL pipeline can be scheduled to run on a regular basis to keep the database updated with the latest sales data.</p>
