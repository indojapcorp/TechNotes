Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform that offers a variety of backend services and tools to help you build high-quality apps. Here&#39;s a brief tutorial to get started with Firebase:</p>

<p>Create a Firebase account: Go to the Firebase website and sign up for a free account. You can use your Google account or create a new one.</p>

<p>Create a new Firebase project: Once you&#39;re logged in, create a new Firebase project from the Firebase console.</p>

<p>Add Firebase to your app: After creating a project, add Firebase to your mobile or web app. Firebase provides detailed documentation for each platform. You&#39;ll need to add Firebase SDKs to your app, configure your app, and initialize Firebase in your app&#39;s code.</p>

<p>Choose Firebase services: Firebase provides a range of services that you can use in your app, including authentication, real-time database, cloud messaging, cloud storage, and more. Choose the services that fit your app&#39;s requirements.</p>

<p>Set up Firebase services: Once you&#39;ve chosen the Firebase services you want to use, set them up by configuring them from the Firebase console. For example, if you&#39;re using authentication, configure the authentication providers you want to use, such as email/password, Google, or Facebook.</p>

<p>Use Firebase services in your app: Once you&#39;ve set up Firebase services, you can use them in your app&#39;s code. Firebase provides detailed documentation for each service and platform, so refer to the documentation to learn how to use the services in your app.</p>

<p>Test and deploy your app: Once you&#39;ve integrated Firebase into your app and added the necessary services, test your app to make sure everything works as expected. Firebase provides tools to help you test your app on various devices and platforms. When you&#39;re ready, deploy your app to the app store or web hosting platform.</p>

<p>Firebase provides a powerful and easy-to-use platform for building high-quality mobile and web apps. Follow these steps to get started with Firebase and explore its many features and services.</p>
