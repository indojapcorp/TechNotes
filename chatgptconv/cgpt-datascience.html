<strong>Question</strong><br />
code sales prediction based on advertising spending, price, and product features using Regression analysis. Implement it in python and various python libraries like numpy ,pandas , Scikit-learn etc.<br />
Sure, here&#39;s an example of how to predict sales based on advertising spending, price, and product features using linear regression in Python with the help of numpy, pandas, and Scikit-learn:</p>

<p>python<br />
Copy code<br />
import numpy as np<br />
import pandas as pd<br />
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression<br />
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split<br />
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score</p>

<p># Load the data from a CSV file<br />
data = pd.read_csv(&#39;sales_data.csv&#39;)</p>

<p># Split the data into training and testing sets<br />
X = data[[&#39;Advertising&#39;, &#39;Price&#39;, &#39;Product Features&#39;]]<br />
y = data[&#39;Sales&#39;]<br />
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)</p>

<p># Fit a linear regression model to the training data<br />
reg = LinearRegression()<br />
reg.fit(X_train, y_train)</p>

<p># Predict sales using the test data<br />
y_pred = reg.predict(X_test)</p>

<p># Evaluate the model&#39;s performance<br />
print(&#39;R^2 score:&#39;, r2_score(y_test, y_pred))<br />
In this example, we first load the sales data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. The DataFrame contains columns for advertising spending, price, product features, and sales. We then split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from Scikit-learn.</p>

<p>Next, we fit a linear regression model to the training data using the LinearRegression class from Scikit-learn. This creates a model that can be used to predict sales based on the values of the independent variables.</p>

<p>We then use the model to predict sales for the test data, and evaluate the model&#39;s performance using the r2_score function from Scikit-learn. This function calculates the coefficient of determination, which measures how well the model fits the data. A value of 1.0 indicates a perfect fit, while a value of 0.0 indicates no correlation between the independent and dependent variables.</p>

<p>Note that in this example, we assume that the sales data is already pre-processed and cleaned. In practice, data cleaning and preprocessing are critical steps in data analysis, and may involve steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.</p>
