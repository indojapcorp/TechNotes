Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for IT projects are usually written by a combination of people, including the IT service provider (e.g., an IT department within an organization, or an external IT vendor) and the client or customer who will receive the IT services.</p>

<p>In most cases, the IT service provider takes the lead in drafting the SLA because they are responsible for providing the services and ensuring that they meet the agreed-upon standards. However, the client or customer is also involved in the process to ensure that the SLA accurately reflects their needs and requirements.</p>

<p>SLAs are typically written collaboratively between the IT service provider and the client, with input from stakeholders and subject matter experts as needed. This helps ensure that the SLA is comprehensive, realistic, and aligned with the expectations and goals of both parties.</p>
