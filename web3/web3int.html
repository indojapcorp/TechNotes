<h3>Web3 Interview Questions (&amp; Answers)</h3>

<h4>Basics</h4>

<p>What is Web1?</p>

<p>What is Web2?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Web2 is the interactive and social web</li>
</ul>

<p>What is Web3?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Web3 is the decentralized internet. It provides native built-in payments while still being self-governing</li>
</ul>

<p>What is consensus?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Consensus is the agreement on what (usually transactions) has happened and what has not</li>
</ul>

<p>What is decentralization?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Decentralisation is the opposite of centralisation and means that something like power, control or trust is not focused on just a few people, but is distributed among many or even all of them.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is a decentralized ledger?</p>

<ul>
	<li>It as a database that gets saved from a group of people and is updated in regular blocks of time</li>
</ul>

<p>What is a DAO?</p>

<ul>
	<li>DAO is an acronym for Decentralized Autonomous Organization</li>
	<li>It is an organization that&rsquo;s governed by code instead of leaders</li>
	<li>A DAO in its simplest form can be described as a group chat with a shared bank account</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the difference between a NFT and a fungible token?</p>

<ul>
	<li>NFTs are unique digital asset like artworks and collectibles. Non fungible tokens are not interchangeable</li>
	<li>Fungible tokens like ether or Bitcoin on the other hand are divisible and replaceable</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the difference between a coin an a token?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sometimes people use the term &quot;coin&quot; and &quot;token&quot; interchangeably. However, there are very big differences between crypto coins and crypto tokens</li>
	<li>A digital coin is an asset that is native to its own blockchain. (BTC, ETH, ...)</li>
	<li>Tokens are created on existing blockchains (all ERC-20 tokens, ...)</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the difference between layer 1 and layer 2 networks?</p>

<ul>
	<li>A layer 1 network describes the underlying &quot;main&quot; blockchain that is the ultimate source of truth and is responsible for the settlement of transactions</li>
	<li>Layer 2 networks extend the functionality of their layer 1 counterpart. For example they increase the transaction speed or lower transaction costs. A layer 2 solution is not a blockchain! (e.g Arbitrum for Ethereum)</li>
	<li>Hint: Layer 1 solutions without scaling limitations usually don&#39;t need scaling solutions</li>
</ul>

<p>What is a side chain?</p>

<ul>
	<li>A side chain is essentially just a blockchain that is linked to another main blockchain. (e.g Liquid Network for Bitcoin, Polygon for Ethereum)</li>
</ul>

<p>What is DeFi?</p>

<ul>
	<li>DeFi is an acronym for decentralized finance</li>
	<li>It is an umbrella term for peer-to-peer financial services</li>
	<li>Typical services include earning interest, borrowing and lending crypto</li>
</ul>

<p>What is a crypto wallet?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Crypto wallets store your private key and let you send and receive cryptocurrencies using a beautiful UI</li>
	<li>Crypto wallets technically don&rsquo;t store your crypto! If you lose your private keys, you lose access to your money and not the money itself</li>
</ul>

<p>Bring the terms &quot;decentralization&quot;, &quot;bitcoin&quot;, &quot;crypto currency&quot;, &quot;consensus&quot; and &quot;blockchain&quot; in an order. (broad to specific)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Consensus -&gt; decentralization -&gt; blockchain -&gt; crypto currency -&gt; bitcoin</li>
</ul>

<p>What are dApps?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Decentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications that have their backend code (smart contracts) running on a decentralized network and not a centralized server</li>
</ul>

<h4>Blockchain And Blockchain Alternatives</h4>

<p>What is a blockchain?</p>

<ul>
	<li>A blockchain is a digital file consisting of records. The number of records is growing in regular blocks of time. All records are linked together using cryptography</li>
	<li>For a blockchain to be decentralised it has to be distributed to a group of people</li>
</ul>

<p>Why are blockchains resistant to modification of their data?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks</li>
</ul>

<p>Tell me the three factors of the blockchain trilemma?</p>

<ul>
	<li>security, decentralization, and scalability -&gt; you can only choose two!</li>
</ul>

<p>What problem does a blockchain solve?</p>

<ul>
	<li>How can I save a digital information in a immutable way without a centralised authority</li>
</ul>

<p>Explain a blockchain alternative</p>

<ul>
	<li>Transactions in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) are linked to one and another directly instead of being grouped and processed in blocks. This makes DAGs more scalable than blockchains in theory</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you &ldquo;hide&rdquo; a transaction on a blockchain?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Transaction can&#39;t be hidden. All transactions are public</li>
</ul>

<p>Where are transactions stored in a blockchain?</p>

<ul>
	<li>In a blockchain, a transaction is stored in a &quot;block&quot;</li>
	<li>This blocks are saved on nodes that are part of the network</li>
</ul>

<p>What is a miner?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Miners are nodes, who receive rewards for verifying transactions and marinating network integrity</li>
</ul>

<p>What is a hard fork?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hard forks are protocol changes which aren&#39;t compatible with the older version of the cryptocurrency. The chain splits into two and the participants can choose to operate in any version</li>
	<li>Immediately after a blockchain forks, the two resulting chains share the exact same transaction history</li>
</ul>

<p>What is a soft fork?</p>

<ul>
	<li>In contrast to a hard fork, soft forks are backward compatible. They don&rsquo;t have a significant impact on the change of protocol and participants can operate within the network without upgrading their software</li>
</ul>

<p>How does Proof of Work work?</p>

<ul>
	<li>The central principle behind PoW consensus is to solve a complex mathematical problem. The first miner to find the right solution, advertise it to the whole network, and receive a reward in cryptocurrency provided by the protocol</li>
	<li>The disadvantage is that it requires a lot of computational power</li>
</ul>

<p>How does Proof of Stake work?</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is a cryptocurrency consensus mechanism</li>
	<li>Proof of Stake tries to deal with the main drawback of PoW</li>
	<li>The central principle behind PoS consensus is that cryptocurrency owners can stake their crypto. From this so called &quot;validators&quot; one then is selected randomly to &quot;mint&quot; a new block. The more coins a person stakes, the higher is the chance to be selected</li>
</ul>

<p>What is a proof of work nonce?</p>

<ul>
	<li>A nonce plays a crucial part in the mining process with PoW. The nonce is the missing piece of the puzzle needed to discover the next block</li>
</ul>

<p>What does &quot;nonce&quot; mean?</p>

<ul>
	<li>&quot;nonce&quot; stands for &quot;Number User Only Once&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cryptography</h4>

<p>What is a hash collision?</p>

<ul>
	<li>A hash collision occurs, if two different inputs lead to the same hash</li>
</ul>

<p>What is symmetric key encryption?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Symmetric key encryption is also called private key cryptography and uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages</li>
</ul>

<p>What is asymmetric key encryption?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Symmetric key encryption is also called public key cryptography and uses two separate keys to encrypt and decrypt messages</li>
	<li>First a private key is randomly generated. With the use of a mathematical formula the public key can be created from the private key. The public key can be shared with everyone, whereas the private key must be kept secret</li>
	<li>Data is encrypted using any one of the keys and decrypted with the other. Unlike with symmetric encryption only the encrypted data (but not the key itself) has to be transferred, making it more secure against man-in-the-middle attacks</li>
</ul>

<p>What is a merkle tree?</p>

<ul>
	<li>A merkle tree is a data structure used to efficiently summarize and validate large data sets</li>
	<li>A merkle tree consists of the merkle root, which is the root hash. The merkle root is then put into the block header of a block</li>
	<li>In a merkle tree, the the transaction hashes are considered the leaves. Each non-leaf node (branch) is a hash of its child hashes</li>
</ul>

<p>Why are merkle trees so important in BTC?</p>

<ul>
	<li>If Bitcoin didn&rsquo;t have merkle trees, every node on the network would need to maintain a full copy of every transaction that has ever happened in Bitcoin</li>
</ul>

<p>Explain the term &quot;zero knowledge proof&quot;</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is a cryptographic method that allows one party to prove the knowledge of certain information to the other party without revealing the data in question</li>
</ul>

<h4>Attacks</h4>

<p>What is a 51% attack?</p>

<ul>
	<li>If a hacker is able to control 51% or more of the nodes, he will gain control over the entire network</li>
</ul>

<p>What is a reentrancy attack?</p>

<ul>
	<li>A reentrancy attack occurs when a function makes an external call to an untrusted contract. The untrusted contract then makes a recursive call back to the original function in an attempt to drain funds</li>
</ul>

<p>Name two ways reentrancy attacks can be prevented</p>

<ul>
	<li>Implementing the checks-effects-interactions pattern (update the state before making external calls)</li>
	<li>Using a reentrancy guard (e.g modifier by OpenZeppelin)</li>
</ul>

<p>What is a replay attack?</p>

<ul>
	<li>A replay attack is taking a transaction on one blockchain, and maliciously or fraudulently repeating it on another blockchain. Two post-fork blockchains are vulnerable for this type of attack</li>
	<li>For a replay attack to work the two chains need to share a common history</li>
</ul>

<p>How can a blockchain prevent replay attacks?</p>

<ul>
	<li>To prevent replay attacks, the developers on one of the two post-fork blockchains can make a slight change to transaction rules</li>
	<li>Ethereum prevents same-chain replay attacks by having a transaction counter in each account. This nonce also prevents double spending</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ethereum</h4>

<p>What is Ethereum?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality</li>
</ul>

<p>What is Ether?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ether is Ethereum&rsquo;s native cryptocurrency</li>
	<li>It provides the nodes an incentive to validate the Ethereum blockchain blocks</li>
</ul>

<p>List some Ethereum development and testing environments</p>

<ul>
	<li>Truffle</li>
	<li>Hardhat</li>
	<li>Brownie</li>
</ul>

<p>How large is the block size of Ethereum?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ethereum does not have a block size limit; blocks use gas limits</li>
</ul>

<p>How big is the block reward of Ethereum?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Currently it is 2 ETH. But this number could change in the future</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the block time of Ethereum?</p>

</ul>

<p>What is the smallest unit of Ether?</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 Wei (10 ** 18 Wei = 1 Ether)</li>
</ul>

<p>Bring the denominations in the right order: Gwei, Mwei, Kwei, Ether, Wei, microether, milliether</p>

<ul>
	<li>Wei, Kwei, Mwei, Gwei, microether, milliether, Ether</li>
</ul>

<p>Who founded Ethereum?</p>

<p>How does Ethereum differ from Bitcoin?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ethereum utilizes blockchain technology not only for maintaining a decentralized payment network but also for storing computer code that can be used to power tamper-proof decentralized smart contracts</li>
</ul>

<p>What are smart contracts?</p>

<ul>
	<li>A smart contract is a program that runs at an address on Ethereum. They&#39;re made up of data and functions that can execute upon receiving a transaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the EVM?</p>

<ul>
	<li>EVM is an acronym for Ethereum Virtual Machine</li>
	<li>EVM acts like a global computer that lends its accumulated computing power to developers</li>
	<li>The EVM can be accessed from anywhere in the world through participating Ethereum nodes</li>
</ul>

<p>What is Enterprise Ethereum?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Enterprise Ethereum is a permissioned version of Ethereum. Permissioned means, that only authorized nodes can join. The Ethereum Mainnet is not permissioned, because anybody can set up a node. In addition these private chains can be setup, that the access to its data is restricted</li>
</ul>

<p>What is a node in Ethereum?</p>

<ul>
	<li>A node is a computer connected to the Ethereum network, which is responsible for processing transactions</li>
</ul>

<p>How can you connect with a node?</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can connect to a node by WS-RPC, JSON-RPC, and IPC-RPC</li>
</ul>

<p>Which consensus mechanism does Ethereum use?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ethereum currently uses proof of Work but plans to use proof of stake in Ethereum 2.0</li>
</ul>

<p>Which programming language is used to write smart contracts in Ethereum?</p>

</ul>

<p>List common smart contract standards</p>

<ul>
	<li>ERC-20: Token Standard</li>
	<li>ERC-165: A standard to publish and detect what interfaces a smart contract implements.</li>
	<li>ERC-721: Non-fungible token standard</li>
	<li>ERC-1155: Multi-token standard</li>
</ul>

<p>What is integer underflow/overflow?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Integer overflows and underflows occur due to the input, whose size does not meet the boundaries of integer variables</li>
	<li>Hint: To avoid this, simply make sure you&rsquo;re using a Solidity compiler version &gt; 0.8, which automatically checks for overflows and underflows</li>
</ul>

<p>What is a frontrunning?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Transactions take some time before they are mined. An attacker can watch the transaction pool and send a transaction, have it included in a block before the original transaction. This mechanism can be abused to re-order transactions to the attacker&#39;s advantage</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the account nonce in Ethereum?</p>

<ul>
	<li>It&#39;s the transaction count of an account</li>
	<li>It prevents replay attacks</li>
</ul>

<p>How can you obtain ether?</p>

<p>What are the two types of Ethereum networks that exist?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Public networks (Mainnet, test networks: Ropsten, Goerli, Kovan, Rinkeby)</li>
	<li>Private networks (Enterprise Ethereum, local networks)</li>
</ul>

<p>Why are gas fees taken?</p>

<ul>
	<li>The creation of consensus in a decentralised system must cost something, because it motivates all participants to save the optimal reality</li>
</ul>

<p>How much gas does a simple Ethereum transaction cost?</p>

<ul>
	<li>A simple transfer of value requires 21&#39;000 gas</li>
</ul>

<p>How many transactions fit into an Ethereum block?</p>

<ul>
	<li>There is no general answer for this, because transactions utilize different amounts of gas and a block has a variable size (depending on network demand)</li>
</ul>

<p>How are the transaction fees calculated in Ethereum after the London upgrade?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Gas units (limit) * (base fee (in Gwei) + priority fee (tip))</li>
	<li>Info: Miners receive the tip and the base fee is burned</li>
	<li>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/#post-london" rel="nofollow">docs</a>&nbsp;to find out more about gas</li>
</ul>

<p>What is an ABI?</p>

<ul>
	<li>ABI is an acronym for Application Binary Interface</li>
	<li>The ABI is the interface to interact with our smart contract</li>
	<li>The ABI can be generated from your smart contract source code (you have to compile it)</li>
</ul>

<p>What do I need to interact with a deployed smart contract?</p>

<ul>
	<li>You need the contract address and the ABI</li>
	<li>The contract address points to the place where the bytecode is located on the blockchain</li>
	<li>The ABI defines which functions you can invoke</li>
</ul>

<p>How are smart contracts stored into the blockchain?</p>

<ul>
	<li>They are stored as bytecode (=binary data) under a specific address also known as contract address</li>
</ul>

<p>Solidity</p>

<p>Why should a developer define a solidity version at the beginning of a file?</p>

<ul>
	<li>It reduces incompatibility glitches that can occur while compiling with another version</li>
</ul>

<p>Why is is hard to generate random numbers in a smart contract?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Solidity contracts are deterministic. Anyone who figures out how your contract produces randomness can anticipate its results and use this information to exploit your application</li>
</ul>

<p>How can random numbers be generated in a smart contract?</p>

<ul>
	<li>To make random numbers unpredictable you must use an oracle to produce randomness off-chain. A popular way is to use ChainLink VRF</li>
</ul>

<p>Why do smart contracts written in Solidity or Viper need to be compiled?</p>

<ul>
	<li>The EVM doesn&#39;t understand these high-level languages. Therefor the source code has to be translated into machine language (bytecode) that the EVM is able to execute</li>
</ul>

<p>Explain the naming conventions for contracts and functions in Solidity</p>

<ul>
	<li>Contract names should be capitalised (e.g TestContract)</li>
	<li>Function names should be mixed-case (e.g superDuperFunction)</li>
	<li>Learn more about the style guide&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Do all functions in a smart contract costs gas?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Functions that modify the state of EVM costs gas, whereas functions that only read the state are free</li>
</ul>

<p>List all valid data types of Solidity</p>

<ul>
	<li>Boolean, Integer, Address, Byte/String, Enum</li>
	<li>The data type &quot;Fixed Point Numbers&quot; also exists, but isn&#39;t fully supported yet</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the result of 7/2 in Solidity?</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is 3 because the decimal gets truncated</li>
</ul>

<p>What data types are not valid keys in a mapping?</p>

<ul>
	<li>The key can be any built-in data type but reference types are not allowed. Not allowed are: Mapping, Struct, Enum or dynamically sized Array.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the advantage of a defining a fallback function in Solidity?</p>

<ul>
	<li>It helps us to protect the function from throwing an error</li>
</ul>

<p>In which two scenarios a fallback function (defined as payable) gets called in Solidity?</p>

<ul>
	<li>A contract receives only ether and no data (msg.data)</li>
	<li>No function name matches the called function</li>
</ul>

<p>What is special about the fallback function in Solidity?</p>

<ul>
	<li>It has no name, arguments or identifier</li>
	<li>It can not return anything</li>
	<li>It can only be defined once per contract</li>
	<li>It is mandatory to mark it external</li>
	<li>It is limited to 2300 gas when called by another function</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the difference between ERC &amp; EIP?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ethereum Request for comments (ERC) define standards for the usage of Ethereum</li>
	<li>Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) improve the Ethereum protocol itself</li>
</ul>
